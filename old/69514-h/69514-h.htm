<p class="ph2">THE BEST MAN</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyril Gordon</span> had been seated at his desk but
ten minutes and was deep in the morning’s mail
when there came an urgent message from his chief,
summoning him to an immediate audience in the
inner office.</p>

<p>The chief had keen blue eyes and shaggy eyebrows.
He never wasted words; yet those words
when spoken had more weight than those of most
other men in Washington.</p>

<p>There was the briefest of good-morning gleams
in his nod and glance, but he only said:</p>

<p>“Gordon, can you take the Pennsylvania train
for New York that leaves the station in thirty-two
minutes?”</p>

<p>The young man was used to abrupt questions
from his chief, but he caught his breath, mentally
surveying his day as it had been planned:</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I suppose I could—if it is necessary——”
He hesitated.</p>

<p>“It is necessary,” said the chief curtly, as if that
settled the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“But—half an hour!” ejaculated Gordon in dismay.
“I could hardly get to my rooms and back
to the station. I don’t see how—— Isn’t there a
train a little later?”</p>

<p>“Later train won’t do. Call up your man on
the ’phone. Tell him to pack your bag and meet
you at the station in twenty minutes. You’ll need
evening clothes. Can you depend on your man to
get your things quickly without fail?”</p>

<p>There was that in the tone of the chief that
caused Gordon to make no further demur.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he responded with his usual business-like
tone, as he strode to the ’phone. His daze was
passing off. “Evening clothes?” he questioned
curiously, as if he might not have heard aright.</p>

<p>“Yes, evening clothes,” was the curt answer,
“and everything you’ll need for daytime for a respectable
gentleman of leisure—a tourist, you understand.”</p>

<p>Gordon perceived that he was being given a mission
of trust and importance, not unmixed with
mystery perhaps. He was new in the secret service,
and it had been his ambition to rise in his chief’s
good graces. He rang the telephone bell furiously
and called up the number of his own apartments, giving
his man orders in a breezy, decisive tone that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
caused a look of satisfaction to settle about the
fine wrinkles of the chief’s eyes.</p>

<p>Gordon’s watch was out and he was telling his
man on just what car he must leave the apartments
for the station. The chief noted it was two cars
ahead of what would have been necessary. His
gray head gave an almost imperceptible nod of commendation,
and his eyes showed that he was content
with his selection of a man.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said Gordon, as he hung up the
receiver, “I’m ready for orders.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are to go to New York, and take
a cab for the Cosmopolis Hotel—your room there
is already secured by wire. Your name is John
Burnham. The name of the hotel and the number
of your room are on this memorandum. You will
find awaiting you an invitation to dine this evening
with a Mr. Holman, who knows of you as an expert
in code-reading. Our men met him on the train
an hour ago and arranged that he should invite you.
He didn’t know whom they represented, of course.
He has already tried to ’phone you at the hotel about
coming to dinner to-night. He knows you are expected
there before evening. Here is a letter of
introduction to him from a man he knows. Our
men got that also. It is genuine, of course.</p>

<p>“Last night a message of national importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
written in cipher, was stolen from one of our men
before it had been read. This is now in the hands
of Holman, who is hoping to have you decipher it
for him and a few guests who will also be present
at dinner. They wish to use it for their own purposes.
Your commission is to get hold of the message
and bring it to us as soon as possible. Another
message of very different import, written
upon the same kind of paper, is in this envelope,
with a translation for you to use in case you have
to substitute a message. You will have to use your
own wits and judgment. The main thing is, <i>get the
paper</i>, and <i>get back with it</i>, with as little delay as
possible. Undoubtedly your life will be in danger
should it be discovered that you have made off with
it. Spare no care to protect yourself <i>and the message</i>,
at all hazards. Remember, I said, <i>and the message</i>,
young man! It means much to the country.</p>

<p>“In this envelope is money—all you will probably
need. Telegraph or ’phone to this address if
you are in trouble. Draw on us for more, if necessary,
also through this same address. Here is the
code you can use in case you find it necessary to telegraph.
Your ticket is already bought. I have sent
Clarkson to the station for it, and he will meet
you at the train. You can give him instructions in
case you find you have forgotten anything. Take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
your mail with you, and telegraph back orders to
your stenographer. I think that is all. Oh, yes,
to-night, while you are at dinner, you will be called
to the ’phone by one of our men. If you are in
trouble, this may give you opportunity to get away,
and put us wise. You will find a motor at the door
now, waiting to take you to the station. If your
man doesn’t get there with your things, take the
train, anyway, and buy some more when you get
to New York. Don’t turn aside from your commission
for anything. Don’t let <i>anything</i> hinder you!
Make it a matter of life and death! Good-morning,
and good luck!”</p>

<p>The chief held out a big, hairy hand that was
surprisingly warm and soft considering the hardness
of his face and voice, and the young man
grasped it, feeling as if he were suddenly being
plunged into waves of an unknown depth and he
would fain hold on to this strong hand.</p>

<p>He went out of the office quietly enough, and the
keen old eyes watched him knowingly, understanding
the beating of the heart under Gordon’s well-fitting
business coat, the mingled elation and dread
over the commission. But there had been no hesitancy,
no question of acceptance, when the nature
of the commission was made known. The young
man was “game.” He would do. Not even an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
eyelash had flickered at the hint of danger. The
chief felt he would be faithful even in the face of
possible death.</p>

<p>Gordon’s man came rushing into the station just
after he reached there himself. Clarkson was
already there with the ticket. Gordon had time to
scribble a message to Julia Bentley, whose perfumed
scrawl he had read on the way down. Julia had
bidden him to her presence that evening. He could
not tell whether he was relieved or sorry to tell her
he could not come. It began to look to him a good
deal as if he would ask Julia Bentley to marry him
some day, when she got tired of playing all the others
off against him, and he could make up his mind to
surrender his freedom to any woman.</p>

<p>He bought a paper and settled himself comfortably
in the parlor-car, but his interest was not in the
paper. His strange commission engaged all his
thoughts. He took out the envelope containing instructions
and went over the matter, looking curiously
at the cipher message and its translation,
which, however, told him nothing. It was the old
chief’s way to keep the business to himself until
such time as he chose to explain. Doubtless it was
safer for both message and messenger that he did
not know the full import of what he was undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Gordon carefully noted down everything that
his chief had told him, comparing it with the written
instructions in the envelope; arranged in his mind
just how he would proceed when he reached New
York; tried to think out a good plan for recovering
the stolen message, but could not; and so decided
to trust to the inspiration of the moment. Then it
occurred to him to clear his overcoat pockets of any
letters or other tell-tale articles and stow them in
his suit-case. He might have to leave his overcoat
behind him. So it would be well to have no clues for
anyone to follow.</p>

<p>Having arranged these matters, and prepared a
few letters with notes for his stenographer, to be
mailed back to her from Philadelphia, he reread
Julia Bentley’s note. When every angular line of
her tall script was imprinted on his memory, he
tore the perfumed note into tiny pieces and dropped
them from the car window.</p>

<p>The question was, did he or did he not want to
ask Julia Bentley to become his wife? He had no
doubt as to what her answer would be. Julia had
made it pretty plain to him that she would rather
have him than any of her other admirers; though
she did like to keep them all attendant upon her.
Well, that was her right so long as she was unmarried.
He had no fault to find with her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
was a fine girl, and everybody liked her. Also, she
was of a good family, and with a modest fortune
in her own right. Everybody was taking it for
granted that they liked each other. It was time he
was married and had a real home, he supposed,
whatever that was—that seemed to have so great
a charm for all his friends. To his eyes, it had as
yet taken on no alluring mirage effect. He had
never known a real home, more than his quiet bachelor
apartments were to him now, where his man
ordered everything as he was told, and the meals
were sent up when wanted. He had money enough
from his inheritance to make things more than comfortable,
and he was deeply interested in the profession
he had chosen.</p>

<p>Still, if he was ever going to marry, it was high
time, of course. But did he want Julia? He could
not quite make it seem pleasant to think of her
in his rooms when he came home at night
tired; she would always be wanting to go to her
endless theatre parties and receptions and dances;
always be demanding his attention. She was bright
and handsome and well dressed, but he had never
made love to her. He could not quite imagine himself
doing so. How did men make love, anyway?
Could one call it love when it was “made” love?
These questions followed one another idly through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
his brain as the landscape whirled past him. If he
had stayed at home, he would have spent the evening
with Julia, as she requested in her note, and there
would probably have been a quiet half-hour after
other callers had gone when he would have stayed
as he had been doing of late, and tried to find out
whether he really cared for her or not.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, they were married, and
she sat beside him now. Would any glad thrill fill
his heart as he looked at her beautiful face and realized
that she was his? He tried to look over toward
the next chair and imagine that the tired, fat old
lady with the double chin and the youthful purple
hat was Julia, but that would not work. He whirled
his chair about and tried it on an empty chair. That
went better; but still no thrill of joy lifted him out
of his sordid self. He could not help thinking about
little trying details. The way Julia looked when
she was vexed. Did one mind that in the woman
one loved? The way she ordered her coachman
about. Would she ever speak so to her husband?
She had a charming smile, but her frown was—well—unbecoming
to say the least.</p>

<p>He tried to keep up the fallacy of her presence.
He bought a magazine that he knew she liked, and
read a story to her (in imagination). He could
easily tell how her black eyes would snap at certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
phrases she disliked. He knew just what her comment
would be upon the heroine’s conduct. It was
an old disputed point between them. He knew
how she would criticize the hero, and somehow he
felt himself in the hero’s place every time she did
it. The story had not been a success, and he felt
a weariness as he laid the magazine aside at the call
for dinner from the dining-car.</p>

<p>Before he had finished his luncheon he had begun
to feel that though Julia might think now that
she would like to marry him, the truth about it was
that she would not enjoy the actual life together
any better than he would. Were all marriages like
that? Did people lose the glamour and just settle
down to endure each other’s faults and make the
most of each other’s pleasant side, and not have
anything more? Or was he getting cynical? Had
he lived alone too long, as his friends sometimes
told him, and so was losing the ability really to love
anybody but himself? He knit his brows, and got
up whistling to go out and see why the train had
stopped so long in this little country settlement.</p>

<p>It was just beyond Princeton, and they were not
far now from New York. It would be most annoying
to be delayed so near to his destination. He
was anxious to get things in train for his evening of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
hard work. It was necessary to find out how the
land lay as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It appeared that there was a wrecked freight
ahead of them, and there would be delay. No one
knew just how long; it would depend on how soon
the wrecking train arrived to help.</p>

<p>Gordon walked nervously up and down the grass
at the side of the track, looking anxiously each way
for sign of the wrecking train. The thought of
Julia did occur to him, but he put it impatiently
away, for he knew just how poorly Julia would bear
a delay on a journey even in his company. He had
been with her once when the engine got off the track
on a short trip down to a Virginia house-party, and
she was the most impatient creature alive, although
it mattered not one whit to any of the rest of the
party whether they made merry on the train or at
their friend’s house. And yet, if Julia were anything
at all to him, would not he like the thought
of her companionship now?</p>

<p>A great white dog hobbled up to him and fawned
upon him as he turned to go back to the train, and
he laid his hand kindly upon the animal’s head, and
noted the wistful eyes upon his face. He was a
noble dog, and Gordon stood for a moment fondling
him. Then he turned impatiently and tramped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
back to his car again. But when he reached the steps
he found that the dog had followed him.</p>

<p>Gordon frowned, half in annoyance, half in
amusement, and sitting down on a log by the wayside
he took the dog’s pink nozzle into his hands,
caressing the white fur above it gently.</p>

<p>The dog whined happily, and Gordon meditated.
How long would the train wait? Would he miss
getting to New York in time for the dinner? Would
he miss the chance to rise in his chief’s good graces?
The chief would expect him to get to New York
some other way if the train were delayed. How
long ought he to wait on possibilities?</p>

<p>All at once he saw the conductor and trainmen
coming back hurriedly. Evidently the train was
about to start. With a final kindly stroke of the
white head, he called a workman nearby, handed
him half a dollar to hold the dog, and sprang on
board.</p>

<p>He had scarcely settled himself into his chair,
however, before the dog came rushing up the aisle
from the other end of the car, and precipitated
himself muddily and noisily upon him.</p>

<p>With haste and perturbation Gordon hurried the
dog to the door and tried to fling him off, but the
poor creature pulled back and clung to the platform
yelping piteously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Just then the conductor came from the other
car and looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>“No dogs allowed in these cars,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you know how to enforce that rule
I wish you would,” said Gordon. “I’m sure I
don’t know what to do with him.”</p>

<p>“Where has he been since you left Washington?”
asked the grim conductor with suspicion in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I certainly haven’t had him secreted about me,
a dog of that size,” remarked the young man dryly.
“Besides, he isn’t my dog. I never saw him before
till he followed me at the station. I’m as anxious
to be rid of him as he is to stay.”</p>

<p>The conductor eyed the young man keenly, and
then allowed a grim sense of humor to appear in one
corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Got a chain or a rope for him?” he asked
more sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” remarked the unhappy attaché of
the dog. “Not having had an appointment with the
dog I didn’t provide myself with a leash for him.”</p>

<p>“Take him into the baggage-car,” said the conductor
briefly, and slammed his way into the next
car.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing else to be done, but it was
most annoying to be thus forced on the notice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
his fellow-travellers, when his commission required
that he be as inconspicuous as possible.</p>

<p>At Jersey City he hoped to escape and leave the
dog to the tender mercies of the baggage man, but
that official was craftily waiting for him and handed
the animal over to his unwilling master with a satisfaction
ill-proportioned to the fee he had received
for caring for him.</p>

<p>Then began a series of misfortunes. Disappointment
and suspicion stalked beside him, and
behind him a voice continually whispered his chief’s
last injunction: “Don’t let anything hinder you!”</p>

<p>Frantically he tried first one place and then another,
but all to no effect. Nobody apparently
wanted to care for a stray white dog, and his very
haste aroused suspicion. Once he came near being
arrested as a dog thief. He could not get rid of that
dog! Yet he must not let him follow him! Would
he have to have the animal sent home to Washington
as the only solution of the problem? Then a queer
fancy seized him that just in some such way had
Miss Julia Bentley been shadowing his days for
nearly three years now; and he had actually this
very day been considering calmly whether he might
not have to marry her, just because she was so persistent
in her taking possession of him. Not that
she was unladylike, of course; no, indeed! She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
stately and beautiful, and had never offended. But
she had always quietly, persistently, taken it for
granted that he would be her attendant whenever she
chose; and she always chose whenever he was in the
least inclined to enjoy any other woman’s company.</p>

<p>He frowned at himself. Was there something
weak about his character that a woman or a dog
could so easily master him? Would any other employee
in the office, once trusted with his great commission,
have allowed it to be hindered by a dog?</p>

<p>Gordon could not afford to waste any more time.
He must get rid of him at once!</p>

<p>The express office would not take a dog without
a collar and chain unless he was crated; and the
delays and exasperating hindrances seemed to be
interminable. But at last, following the advice of a
kindly officer, he took the dog to an institution in
New York where, he was told, dogs were boarded
and cared for, and where he finally disposed of him,
having first paid ten dollars for the privilege. As
he settled back in a taxicab with his watch in his
hand, he congratulated himself that he had still
ample time to reach his hotel and get into evening
dress before he must present himself for his work.</p>

<p>Within three blocks of the hotel the cab came
to such a sudden standstill that Gordon was thrown
to his knees.</p>

in which policemen were a prominent feature. The
chauffeur seemed dazed in the hands of the officers.</p>

<p>A little, barefoot, white-faced figure huddled
limply in the midst showed Gordon what had happened:
also there were menacing glances towards
himself and a show of lifted stones. He heard
one boy say: “You bet he’s in a hurry to git away.
Them kind allus is. They don’t care who they kills,
they don’t!”</p>

<p>A great horror seized him. The cab had run
over a newsboy and perhaps killed him. Yet instantly
came the remembrance of his commission:
“Don’t let anything hinder you. Make it a matter
of life and death!” Well, it looked as if this was
a matter of death that hindered him now.</p>

<p>They bundled the moaning boy into the taxicab
and as Gordon saw no escape through the tightly
packed crowd, who eyed him suspiciously, he
climbed in beside the grimy little scrap of unconscious
humanity, and they were off to the hospital
to the tune of “Don’t let anything hinder you!
Don’t let anything hinder you!” until Gordon felt
that if it did not stop soon he would go crazy. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
meditated opening the cab door and making his
escape in spite of the speed they were making, but
a vision of broken legs and a bed in the hospital for
himself held him to his seat. One of the policemen
had climbed on in front with the chauffeur, and now
and again he glanced back as if he were conveying
a couple of prisoners to jail. It was vexatious beyond
anything! And all on account of that white dog!
Could anything be more ridiculous than the whole
performance?</p>

<p>His annoyance and irritation almost made him
forget that it was his progress through the streets
that had silenced this mite beside him. But just as
he looked at his watch for the fifth time the boy
opened his eyes and moaned, and there was in those
eyes a striking resemblance to the look in the eyes
of the dog of whose presence he had but just rid
himself.</p>

<p>Gordon started. In spite of himself it seemed
as if the dog were reproaching him through the
eyes of the child. Then suddenly the boy spoke.</p>

<p>“Will yous stay by me till I’m mended?” whispered
the weak little voice.</p>

<p>Gordon’s heart leaped in horror again, and it
came to him that he was being tried out this day
to see if he had the right stuff in him for hard tasks.
The appeal in the little street-boy’s eyes reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
him as no request had ever yet done, and yet he
might not answer it. Duty,—life and death duty,—called
him elsewhere, and he must leave the little
fellow whom he had been the involuntary cause of
injuring, to suffer and perhaps to die. It cut him
to the quick not to respond to that urgent appeal.</p>

<p>Was it because he was weary that he was visited
just then by a vision of Julia Bentley with her
handsome lips curled scornfully? Julia Bentley
would not have approved of his stopping to carry
a boy to the hospital, any more than to care for a
dog’s comfort.</p>

<p>“Look here, kiddie,” he said gently, leaning
over the child, “I’d stay by you if I could, but I’ve
already made myself late for an appointment by
coming so far with you. Do you know what Duty
is?”</p>

<p>The child nodded sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t yous mind me,” he murmured weakly.
“Just yous go. I’m game all right.” Then the
voice trailed off into silence again, and the eyelids
fluttered down upon the little, grimy, unconscious
face.</p>

<p>Gordon went into the hospital for a brief moment
to leave some money in the hands of the
authorities for the benefit of the boy, and a message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
that he would return in a week or two if possible;
then hurried away.</p>

<p>Back in the cab once more, he felt as if he had
killed a man and left him lying by the roadside while
he continued his unswerving march toward the
hideous duty which was growing momently more
portentous, and to be relieved of which he would
gladly have surrendered further hope of his chief’s
favor. He closed his eyes and tried to think, but all
the time the little white face of the child came before
his vision, and the mocking eyes of Julia Bentley
tantalized him, as if she were telling him that he had
spoiled all his chances—and hers—by his foolish
soft-heartedness. Though, what else could he have
done than he had done, he asked himself fiercely.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was at least ten
minutes’ ride to the hotel, the best time they could
make. Thanks to his man the process of dressing
for evening would not take long, for he knew that
everything would be in place and he would not be
hindered. He would make short work of his toilet.
But there was his suit-case. It would not do to leave
it at the hotel, neither must he take it with him to the
house where he was to be a guest. There was nothing
for it but to go around by the way of the station
where it would have to be checked. That meant a
longer ride and more delay, but it must be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Arrived at the hotel at last and in the act of
signing the unaccustomed “John Burnham” in the
hotel registry, there came a call to the telephone.</p>

<p>With a hand that trembled from excitement he
took the receiver. His breath went from him as
though he had just run up five flights of stairs.
“Yes? Hello! Oh, Mrs. Holman. Yes! Burnham.
I’ve but just arrived. I was delayed. A
wreck ahead of the train. Very kind of you to invite
me, I’m sure. Yes, I’ll be there in a few moments,
as soon as I can get rid of the dust of travel. Thank
you. Good-by.”</p>

<p>It all sounded very commonplace to the clerk,
who was making out bills and fretting because he
could not get off to take his girl to the theatre that
night, but as Gordon hung up the receiver he looked
around furtively as if expecting to see a dozen detectives
ready to seize upon him. It was the first time
he had ever undertaken a commission under an
assumed name and he felt as if he were shouting
his commission through the streets of New York.</p>

<p>The young man made short work of his toilet.
Just as he was leaving the hotel a telegram was
handed him. It was from his chief, and so worded
that to the operator who had copied it down it read
like a hasty call to Boston; but to his code-enlightened
eyes it was merely a blind to cover his exit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
from the hotel and from New York, and set any possible
hunters on a wrong scent. He marvelled at the
wonderful mind of his chief, who thought out every
detail of an important campaign, and forgot not one
little possible point where difficulty might arise.</p>

<p>Gordon had a nervous feeling as he again stepped
into a taxicab and gave his order. He wondered
how many stray dogs, and newsboys with broken
legs, would attach themselves to him on the way to
dinner. Whenever the speed slowed down, or they
were halted by cars and autos, his heart pounded
painfully, lest something new had happened, but he
arrived safely and swiftly at the station, checked
his suit-case, and took another cab to the residence
of Mr. Holman, without further incident.</p>

<p>The company were waiting for him, and after
the introductions they went immediately to the dining-room.
Gordon took his seat with the feeling
that he had bungled everything hopelessly, and had
arrived so late that there was no possible hope of
his doing what he had been sent to do. For the first
few minutes his thoughts were a jumble, and his
eyes dazed with the brilliant lights of the room. He
could not single out the faces of the people present
and differentiate them one from another. His heart
beat painfully against the stiff expanse of evening
linen. It almost seemed as if those near him could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
hear it. He found himself starting and stammering
when he was addressed as “Mr. Burnham.” His
thoughts were mingled with white dogs, newsboys,
and ladies with scornful smiles.</p>

<p>He was seated on the right of his hostess, and
gradually her gentle manners gave him quietness.
He began to gain control of himself, and now he
seemed to see afar the keen eye of his chief watching
the testing of his new commissioner. His heart
swelled to meet the demand made upon him. A
strong purpose came to him to rise above all obstacles
and conquer in spite of circumstances. He must
forget everything else and rise to the occasion.</p>

<p>From that moment the dancing lights that multiplied
themselves in the glittering silver and cut
glass of the table began to settle into order; and
slowly, one by one, the conglomeration of faces
around the board resolved itself into individuals.</p>

<p>There was the pretty, pale hostess, whose gentle
ways seemed hardly to fit with her large, boisterous,
though polished husband. Unscrupulousness was
written all over his ruddy features, also a certain
unhidden craftiness which passed for geniality
among his kind.</p>

<p>There were two others with faces full of cunning,
both men of wealth and culture. One did not
think of the word “refinement” in connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
them; still, that might be conceded also; but it was
all dominated by the cunning that on this occasion,
at least, was allowed to sit unmasked upon their
countenances. They had outwitted an enemy, and
they were openly exultant.</p>

<p>Of the other guests, one was very young and
sleek, with eyes that had early learned to evade;
one was old and weary-looking, with a hunted expression;
one was thick-set, with little eyes set close
in a fat, selfish face. Gordon began to understand
that these three but did the bidding of the others.
They listened to the conversation merely from a
business standpoint and not with any personal
interest. They were there because they were needed,
and not because they were desired.</p>

<p>There was one bond which they seemed to hold
in common: an alert readiness to combine for their
mutual safety. This did not manifest itself in anything
tangible, but the guest felt that it was there
and ready to spring upon him at any instant.</p>

<p>All this came gradually to the young man as the
meal with its pleasant formalities began. As yet
nothing had been said about the reason for his
being there.</p>

<p>“Did you tell me you were in a wreck?” suddenly
asked the hostess sweetly, turning to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and the table talk hushed instantly while the host
asked: “A wreck! Was it serious?”</p>

<p>Gordon perceived his mistake at once. With
instant caution, he replied smilingly, “Oh, nothing
serious, a little break-down on a freight ahead, which
required time to patch up. It reminded me——”
and then he launched boldly into one of the bright
dinner stories for which he was noted among his
companions at home. His heart was beating wildly,
but he succeeded in turning the attention of the table
to his joke, instead of to asking from where he had
come and on what road. Questions about himself
were dangerous he plainly saw, if he would get
possession of the valued paper and get away without
leaving a trail behind him. He succeeded in one
thing more, which, though he did not know it, was
the very thing his chief had hoped he would do when
he chose him instead of a man who had wider experience;
he made every man at the table feel that
he was delightful, a man to be thoroughly trusted
and enjoyed; who would never suspect them of having
any ulterior motives in anything they were doing.</p>

<p>The conversation for a little time rippled with
bright stories and repartee, and Gordon began to
feel almost as if he were merely enjoying a social
dinner at home, with Julia Bentley down the table
listening and haughtily smiling her approval. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the time the incidents of the dog and the newsboy
were forgotten, and the young man felt his self-respect
rising. His heart was beginning to get
into normal action again and he could control his
thoughts. Then suddenly, the crisis arrived.</p>

<p>The soup and fish courses had been disposed of,
and the table was being prepared for the entrée.
The host leaned back genially in his chair and said,
“By the way, Mr. Burnham, did you know I had
an axe to grind in asking you here this evening?
That sounds inhospitable, doesn’t it? But I’m sure
we’re all grateful to the axe that has given us the
opportunity of meeting you. We are delighted at
having discovered you.”</p>

<p>Gordon bowed, smiling at the compliment, and
the murmurs of hearty assent around the table
showed him that he had begun well. If only he
could keep it up! But how, <i>how</i>, was he to get
possession of that magic bit of paper and take it
away with him?</p>

<p>“Mr. Burnham, I was delighted to learn through
a friend that you are an expert in code-reading.
I wonder, did the message that my friend Mr. Burns
sent you this morning give you any intimation that
I wanted you to do me a favor?”</p>

<p>Gordon bowed again. “Yes: it was intimated
to me that you had some message you would like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
deciphered, and I have also a letter of introduction
from Mr. Burns.”</p>

<p>Here Gordon took the letter of introduction
from his pocket and handed it across the table to his
host, who opened it genially, as if it were hardly
necessary to read what was written within since they
already knew so delightfully the man whom it introduced.
The duplicate cipher writing in Gordon’s
pocket crackled knowingly when he settled his coat
about him again, as if it would say, “My time is
coming! It is almost here now.”</p>

<p>The young man wondered how he was to get it
out without being seen, in case he should want to
use it, but he smiled pleasantly at his host with no
sign of the perturbation he was feeling.</p>

<p>“You see,” went on Mr. Holman, “we have an
important message which we cannot read, and our
expert who understands all these matters is out of
town and cannot return for some time. It is necessary
that we know as soon as possible the import
of this writing.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking Mr. Holman drew from
his pocket a long, soft leather wallet and took therefrom
a folded paper which Gordon at once recognized
as the duplicate of the one he carried in his
pocket. His head seemed to reel, and all the lights
go dark before him as he reached a cold hand out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
for the paper. He saw in it his own advancement
coming to his eager grasp, yet when he got it would
he be able to hold it? Something of the coolness
of a man facing a terrible danger came to him now.
By sheer force of will he held his trembling fingers
steady as he took the bit of paper and opened it
carelessly, as if he had never heard of it before, saying
as he did so:</p>

<p>“I will do my best.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence as every eye was
fixed upon him while he unfolded the paper. He
gave one swift glance about the table before he
dropped his eyes to the task. Every face held the
intensity of almost terrible eagerness, and on every
one but that of the gentle hostess sat cunning—craft
that would stop at nothing to serve its own
ends. It was a moment of almost awful import.</p>

<p>The next instant Gordon’s glance went down to
the paper in his hand, and his brain and heart were
seized in the grip of fright. There was no other
word to describe his feeling. The message before
him was clearly written in the code of the home
office, and the words stared at him plainly without
the necessity of study. The import of them was the
revelation of one of the most momentous questions
that had to do with the Secret Service work, a question
the answer to which had puzzled the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
department for weeks. That answer he now held
in his hand, and he knew that if it should come to
the knowledge of those outside before it had done
its work through the department it would result in
dire calamity to the cause of righteousness in the
country, and incidentally crush the inefficient messenger
who allowed it to become known. For the
instant Gordon felt unequal to the task before him.
How could he keep these bloodhounds at bay—for
such they were, he perceived from the import of the
message, bloodhounds who were getting ill-gotten
gains from innocent and unsuspecting victims—some
of them little children.</p>

<p>But the old chief had picked his man well. Only
for an instant the glittering lights darkened before
his eyes and the cold perspiration started. Then he
rallied his forces and looked up. The welfare of a
nation’s honor was in his hands, and he would be
true. It was a matter of life and death, and he
would save it or lose his own life if need be.</p>

<p>He summoned his ready smile.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to serve you if I can,” he said.
“Of course I’d like to look this over a few minutes
before attempting to read it. Codes are different,
you know, from one another, but there is a key to
them all if one can just find it out. This looks as
if it might be very simple.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The spell of breathlessness was broken. The
guests relaxed and went on with their dinner.</p>

<p>Gordon, meanwhile, tried coolly to keep up a
pretense of eating, the paper held in one hand while
he seemed to be studying it. Once he turned it over
and looked on the back. There was a large cross-mark
in red ink at the upper end. He looked at it
curiously and then instinctively at his host.</p>

<p>“That is my own mark,” said Mr. Holman. “I
put it there to distinguish it from other papers.”
He was smiling politely, but he might as well have
said, “I put it there to identify it in case of theft;”
for every one at the table, unless it might be his
wife, understood that that was what he meant. Gordon
felt it and was conscious of the other paper
in his vest-pocket. The way was going to be most
difficult.</p>

<p>Among the articles in the envelope which the
chief had given him before his departure from
Washington were a pair of shell-rimmed eye-glasses,
a false mustache, a goatee, and a pair of eyebrows.
He had laughed at the suggestion of high-tragedy
contained in the disguise, but had brought them with
him for a possible emergency. The eye-glasses were
tucked into the vest-pocket beside the duplicate
paper. He bethought himself of them now. Could
he, under cover of taking them out, manage to exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the papers? And if he should, how about
that red-ink mark across the back? Would anyone
notice its absence? It was well to exchange the
papers as soon as possible before the writing had
been studied by those at the table, for he knew that
the other message, though resembling this one in
general words, differed enough to attract the attention
of a close observer. Dared he risk their noticing
the absence of the red cross on the back?</p>

<p>Slowly, cautiously, under cover of the conversation,
he managed to get that duplicate paper out
of his pocket and under the napkin in his lap. This
he did with one hand, all the time ostentatiously
holding the code message in the other hand, with its
back to the people at the table. This hand meanwhile
also held his coat lapel out that he might the
more easily search his vest-pockets for the glasses.
It all looked natural. The hostess was engaged in
a whispered conversation with the maid at the
moment. The host and other guests were finishing
the exceedingly delicious patties on their plates, and
the precious code message was safely in evidence,
red cross and all. They saw no reason to be suspicious
about the stranger’s hunt for his glasses.</p>

<p>“Oh, here they are!” he said, quite unconcernedly,
and put on the glasses to look more closely
at the paper, spreading it smoothly on the table cloth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
before him, and wondering how he should get it
into his lap in place of the one that now lay quietly
under his napkin.</p>

<p>The host and the guests politely refrained from
talking to Gordon and told each other incidents of
the day in low tones that indicated the non-importance
of what they were saying; while they waited
for the real business of the hour.</p>

<p>Then the butler removed the plates, pausing beside
Gordon waiting punctiliously with his silver
tray to brush away the crumbs.</p>

<p>This was just what Gordon waited for. It had
come to him as the only way. Courteously he drew
aside, lifting the paper from the table and putting
it in his lap, for just the instant while the butler did
his work; but in that instant the paper with the red
cross was slipped under the napkin, and the other
paper took its place upon the table, back down so
that its lack of a red cross could not be noted.</p>

<p>So far, so good, but how long could this be kept
up? And the paper under the napkin—how was it
to be got into his pocket? His hands were like
ice now, and his brain seemed to be at boiling heat
as he sat back and realized that the deed was done,
and could not be undone. If anyone should pick
up that paper from the table and discover the lack of
the red mark, it would be all up with him. He looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
up for an instant to meet the gaze of the six men
upon him. They had nothing better to do now than
to look at him until the next course arrived. He
realized that not one of them would have mercy
upon him if they knew what he had done, not one
unless it might be the tired, old-looking one, and he
would not dare interfere.</p>

<p>Still Gordon was enabled to smile, and to say
some pleasant nothings to his hostess when she
passed him the salted almonds. His hand lay carelessly
guarding the secret of the paper on the table,
innocently, as though it just <i>happened</i> that he laid
it on the paper.</p>

<p>Sitting thus with the real paper in his lap under
his large damask napkin, the false paper under his
hand on the table where he from time to time perused
it, and his eye-glasses which made him look
most distinguished still on his nose, he heard the
distant telephone bell ring.</p>

<p>He remembered the words of his chief and sat
rigid. From his position he could see the tall clock
in the hall, and its gilded hands pointed to ten
minutes before seven. It was about the time his
chief had said he would be called on the telephone.
What should he do with the two papers?</p>

<p>He had but an instant to think until the well-trained
butler returned and announced that some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
one wished to speak with Mr. Burnham on the
telephone. His resolve was taken. He would have
to leave the substitute paper on the table. To carry
it away with him might arouse suspicion, and, moreover,
he could not easily manage both without being
noticed. The real paper must be put safely away
at all hazards, and he must take the chance that the
absence of the red mark would remain unnoticed
until his return.</p>

<p>Deliberately he laid a heavy silver spoon across
one edge of the paper on the table, and an icecream
fork across the other, as if to hold it in place
until his return. Then, rising with apologies,
he gathered his napkin, paper, and all in his hand,
holding it against his coat most naturally, as
if he had forgotten that he had it, and made his
way into the front hall, where in an alcove was the
telephone. As he passed the hat-rack he swept
his coat and hat off with his free hand, and bore
them with him, devoutly hoping that he was not
being watched from the dining-room. Could he
possibly get from the telephone out the front door
without being seen? Hastily he hid the cipher message
in an inner pocket. The napkin he dropped on
the little telephone table, and taking up the receiver
he spoke: “Hello! Yes! Oh, good evening! You
don’t say so! How did that happen?” He made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
his voice purposely clear, that it might be heard
in the dining-room if anyone was listening. Then
glancing in that direction he saw, to his horror, his
host lean over and lift the cipher paper he had left
on the table and hand it to the guest on his right.</p>

<p>The messenger at the other end had given his
sentence agreed upon and he had replied according
to the sentences laid down by the chief in his instructions;
the other end had said good-by and
hung up, but Gordon’s voice spoke, cool and clear
in the little alcove, despite his excitement. “All
right. Certainly, I can take time to write it down.
Wait until I get my pencil. Now, I’m ready. Have
you it there? I’ll wait a minute until you get it.”
His heart beat wildly. The blood surged through
his ears like rushing waters. Would they look for
the little red mark? The soft clink of spoons and
dishes and the murmur of conversation was still
going on, but there was no doubt but that it was a
matter of a few seconds before his theft would be
discovered. He must make an instant dash for liberty
while he yet could. Cautiously, stealthily, like
a shadow from the alcove, one eye on the dining-room,
he stole to the door and turned the knob.
Yet even as he did so he saw his recent host rise
excitedly from his seat and fairly snatch the paper
from the man who held it. His last glimpse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
room where he had but three minutes before been
enjoying the hospitality of the house was a vision
of the entire company starting up and pointing to
himself even as he slid from sight. There was no
longer need for silence. He had been discovered
and must fight for his life. He shut the door quickly,
his nerves so tense that it seemed as if something
must break soon; opened and slammed the outer
door, and was out in the great whirling city under
the flare of electric lamps with only the chance of a
second of time before his pursuers would be upon
him.</p>

<p>He came down the steps with the air of one who
could scarcely take time to touch his feet to the
ground, but must fly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> in front of the house stood a closed carriage
with two fine horses, but the coachman was
looking up anxiously toward the next building. The
sound of the closing door drew the man’s attention,
and, catching Gordon’s eye, he made as if to jump
down and throw open the door of the carriage.
Quick as a flash, Gordon saw he had been mistaken
for the man the carriage awaited, and he determined
to make use of the circumstance.</p>

<p>“Don’t get down,” he called to the man, taking
chances. “It’s very late already. I’ll open the
door. Drive for all you’re worth.” He jumped in
and slammed the carriage door behind him, and in
a second more the horses were flying down the street.
A glance from the back window showed an excited
group of his fellow-guests standing at the open door
of the mansion he had just left pointing toward his
carriage and wildly gesticulating. He surmised that
his host was already at the telephone calling for
his own private detective.</p>

<p>Gordon could scarcely believe his senses that he
had accomplished his mission and flight so far, and
yet he knew his situation was most precarious.
Where he was going he neither knew nor cared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
When he was sure he was far enough from the house
he would call to the driver and give him directions,
but first he must make sure that the precious paper
was safely stowed away, in case he should be caught
and searched. They might be coming after him with
motor-cycles in a minute or two.</p>

<p>Carefully rolling the paper into a tiny compass,
he slipped it into a hollow gold case which was among
the things in the envelope the chief had given him.
There was a fine chain attached to the case, and the
whole looked innocently like a gold pencil. The
chain he slipped about his neck, dropping the case
down inside his collar. That done he breathed more
freely. Only from his dead body should they take
that away. Then he hastily put on the false eyebrows,
mustache, and goatee which had been provided
for his disguise, and pulling on a pair of light
gloves he felt more fit to evade detection.</p>

<p>He was just beginning to think what he should
say to the driver about taking him to the station,
for it was important that he get out of the city at
once, when, glancing out of the window to see what
part of the city he was being taken through he became
aware of an auto close beside the carriage keeping
pace with it, and two men stretching their necks
as if to look into the carriage window at him. He
withdrew to the shadow instantly so that they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
not see him, but the one quick glance he had made
him sure that one of his pursuers was the short
thick-set man with the cruel jaw who had sat across
from him at the dinner-table a few minutes before.
If this were so he had practically no chance at all
of escape, for what was a carriage against a swift
moving car and what was he against a whole city full
of strangers and enemies? If he attempted to drop
from the carriage on the other side and escape into
the darkness he had but a chance of a thousand at
not being seen, and he could not hope to hide and
get away in this unknown part of the city. Yet he
must take his chance somehow, for the carriage must
sooner or later get somewhere and he be obliged to
face his pursuers.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, just at the instant when
he had decided to jump at the next dark place and
was measuring the distance with his eye, his hand
even being outstretched to grasp the door handle,
a blustering, boisterous motor-cycle burst into full
bloom just where he intended to jump, and the man
who rode it was in uniform. He dodged back into
the darkness of the carriage again that he might
not be seen, and the motor-cycle came so near that
its rider turned a white face and looked in. He felt
that his time had come, and his cause was lost. It
had not yet occurred to him that the men who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
pursuing him would hardly be likely to call in municipal
aid in their search, lest their own duplicity would
be discovered. He reasoned that he was dealing
with desperate men who would stop at nothing to get
back the original cipher paper, and stop his mouth.
He was well aware that only death would be considered
a sufficient silencer for him after what he had
seen at Mr. Holman’s dinner-table, for the evidence
he could give would involve the honor of every man
who had sat there. He saw in a flash that the two
henchmen whom he was sure were even now riding
in the car on his right had been at the table for the
purpose of silencing him if he showed any signs of
giving trouble. The wonder was that any of them
dared call in a stranger on a matter of such grave
import which meant ruin to them all if they were
found out, but probably they had reasoned that every
man had his price and had intended to offer him
a share of the booty. It was likely that the chief had
caused it to be understood by them that he was the
right kind of man for their purpose. Yet, of course,
they had taken precautions, and now they had him
well caught, an auto on one side, a motor-cycle on
the other and no telling how many more behind!
He had been a fool to get into this carriage. He
might have known it would only trap him to his
death. There seemed absolutely no chance for escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
now—yet he must fight to the last. He put his
hand on his revolver to make sure it was easy to get
at, tried to think whether it would not be better to
chew up and swallow that cipher message rather
than to run the risk of its falling again into the hands
of the enemy; decided that he must carry it intact
to his chief if possible; and finally that he must make
a dash for safety at once, when just then the carriage
turned briskly into a wide driveway, and the
attendant auto and motor-cycle dropped behind as
if puzzled at the move. The carriage stopped short
and a bright light from an open doorway was flung
into his face. There seemed to be high stone walls
on one side and the lighted doorway on the other
hand evidently led into a great stone building. He
could hear the puffing of the car and cycle just behind.
A wild notion that the carriage had been
placed in front of the house to trap him in case
he tried to escape, and that he had been brought to
prison, flitted through his mind.</p>

<p>His hand was on his revolver as the coachman
jumped down to fling open the carriage door, for he
intended to fight for his liberty to the last.</p>

<p>He glanced back through the carriage window,
and the lights of the auto glared in his face. The
short, thick-set man was getting out of the car,
and the motor-cyclist had stood his machine up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
against the wall and was coming toward the carriage.
Escape was going to be practically impossible. A
wild thought of dashing out the opposite door of
his carriage, boldly seizing the motor-cycle and making
off on it passed through his mind, and then the
door on his left was flung open and the carriage
was immediately surrounded by six excited men in
evening dress all talking at once. “Here you are
at last!” they chorused.</p>

<p>“Where is the best man?” shouted some one
from the doorway. “Hasn’t he come either?” And
as if in answer one of the men by the carriage door
wheeled and called excitedly: “Yes, he’s come! Tell
him—tell Jeff—tell him he’s come.” Then turning
once more to Gordon he seized him by the arm and
cried: “Come on quickly! There isn’t a minute to
wait. The organist is fairly frantic. Everybody
has been just as nervous as could be. We couldn’t
very well go on without you—you know. But don’t
let that worry you. It’s all right now you’ve come.
Forget it, old man, and hustle.” Dimly Gordon perceived
above the sound of subdued hubbub that an
organ was playing, and even as he listened it burst
into the joyous notes of the wedding march. It
dawned upon him that this was not a prison to which
he had come but a church—not a court-room but a
wedding, and horror of horrors! they took him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
for the best man. His disguise had been his undoing.
How was he to get out of this scrape? And
with his pursuers just behind!</p>

<p>“Let me explain——” he began, and wondered
what he could explain.</p>

<p>“There’s no time for explanations now, man.
I tell you the organ has begun the march. We’re
expected to be marching down that middle aisle this
very minute and Jeff is waiting for us in the chapel.
I sent the signal to the bride and another to the
organist the minute we sighted you. Come on!
Everybody knows your boat was late in coming in.
You don’t need to explain a thing till afterwards.”</p>

<p>At that moment one of the ushers moved aside
and the short, thick-set man stepped between, the
light shining full upon his face, and Gordon knew
him positively for the man who had sat opposite
him at the table a few minutes before. He was
peering eagerly into the carriage door and Gordon
saw his only escape was into the church. With his
heart pounding like a trip hammer he yielded himself
to the six ushers, who swept the little pursuer
aside as if he had been a fly and literally bore Gordon
up the steps and into the church door.</p>

<p>A burst of music filled his senses, and dazzling
lights, glimpses of flowers, palms and beautiful garments
bewildered him. His one thought was for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
escape from his pursuers. Would they follow him
into the church and drag him out in the presence
of all these people, or would they be thrown off the
track for a little while and give him opportunity
yet to get away? He looked around wildly for a
place of exit but he was in the hands of the insistent
ushers. One of them chattered to him in a low,
growling whisper, such as men use on solemn
occasions:</p>

<p>“It must have been rough on you being anxious
like this about getting here, but never mind now.
It’ll go all right. Come on. Here’s our cue and
there stands Jefferson over there. You and he go
in with the minister, you know. The groom and
the best man, you understand, they’ll tell you when.
Jeff has the ring all right, so you won’t need to
bother about that. There’s absolutely nothing for
you to do but stand where you’re put and go out
when the rest do. You needn’t feel a bit nervous.”</p>

<p>Was it possible that these crazy people didn’t
recognize their mistake even yet here in the bright
light? Couldn’t they see his mustache was stuck
on and one eyebrow was crooked? Didn’t they know
their best man well enough to recognize his voice?
Surely, surely, some one would discover the mistake
soon—that man Jeff over there who was eyeing
him so intently. He would be sure to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
this was not his friend. Yet every minute that they
continued to think so was a distinct gain for Gordon,
puzzling his pursuers and giving himself time to
think and plan and study his strange surroundings.</p>

<p>And now they were drawing him forward and a
turn of his head gave him a vision of the stubbed
head of the thick-set man peering in at the chapel
door and watching him eagerly. He must fool him
if possible.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know anything about the arrangements,”
faltered Gordon, reflecting that the best
man might not be very well known to the ushers and
perhaps he resembled him. It was not the first time
he had been taken for another man—and with his
present make-up and all, perhaps it was natural.
Could he possibly hope to bluff it out for a few
minutes until the ceremony was over and then
escape? It would of course be the best way imaginable
to throw that impudent little man in the doorway
off his track. If the real best man would only
stay away long enough it would not be a difficult
part to play. The original man might turn up after
he was gone and create a pleasant little mystery, but
nobody would be injured thereby. All this passed
through his mind while the usher kept up his sepulchral
whisper:</p>

<p>“Why, there are just the usual arrangements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
you know—nothing new. You and Jeff go in after
the ushers have reached the back of the church and
opened the door. Then you just stand there till
Celia and her uncle come up the aisle. Then follows
the ceremony—very brief. Celia had all that repeating
after the minister cut out on account of not
being able to rehearse. It’s to be just the simplest
service, not the usual lengthy affair. Don’t worry,
you’ll be all right, old man. Hurry! They’re calling
you. Leave your hat right here. Now I must go.
Keep cool. It’ll soon be over.”</p>

<p>The breathless usher hurried through the door
and settled into a sort of exalted hobble to the time
of the wonderful Lohengrin music. Gordon turned,
thinking even yet to make a possible escape, but the
eagle-eye of his pursuer was upon him and the man
Jefferson was by his side:</p>

<p>“Here we are!” he said, eagerly grabbing Gordon’s
hat and coat and dumping them on a chair.
“I’ll look after everything. Just come along. It’s
time we went in. The doctor is motioning for us.
Awfully glad to see you at last. Too bad you had to
rush so. How many years is it since I saw you?
Ten! You’ve changed some, but you’re looking fine
and dandy. No need to worry about anything. It’ll
soon be over and the knot tied.”</p>

<p>Mechanically Gordon fell into place beside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
man Jefferson, who was a pleasant-faced youth,
well-groomed and handsome. Looking furtively at
his finely-cut, happy features, Gordon wondered if
he would feel as glad as this youth seemed to be,
when he walked down the aisle to meet his bride.
How, by the way, would he feel if he were going to
be married now,—going into the face of this great
company of well-dressed people to meet Miss Julia
Bentley and be joined to her for life? Instinctively
his soul shrank within him at the thought.</p>

<p>But now the door was wide open, the organ pealing
its best, and he suddenly became aware of many
eyes, and of wondering how long his eyebrows
would withstand the perspiration that was trickling
softly down his forehead. His mustache—ridiculous
appendage! why had he not removed it?—was
it awry? Dared he put up his hand to see? His
gloves! Would anyone notice that they were not
as strictly fresh as a best man’s gloves should be?
Then he took his first step to the music, and it was
like being pulled from a delicious morning nap and
plunged into a tub of icy water.</p>

<p>He walked with feet that suddenly weighed like
lead, across a church that looked to be miles in width,
in the face of swarms of curious eyes. He tried to
reflect that these people were all strangers to him,
that they were not looking at him, anyway, but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the bridegroom by his side, and that it mattered very
little what he did, so long as he kept still and braved
it out, if only the real best man didn’t turn up until
he was well out of the church. Then he could
vanish in the dark, and go by some back way to a car
or a taxicab and so to the station. The thought of
the paper inside the gold pencil-case filled him with
a sort of elation. If only he could get out of this
dreadful church, he would probably get away safely.
Perhaps even the incident of the wedding might
prove to be his protection, for they would never seek
him in a crowded church at a fashionable wedding.</p>

<p>The man by his side managed him admirably,
giving him a whispered hint, a shove, or a push now
and then, and getting him into the proper position.
It seemed as if the best man had to occupy the most
trying spot in all the church, but as they put him
there, of course it was right. He glanced furtively
over the faces near the front, and they all looked
quite satisfied, as if everything were going as it
should, so he settled down to his fate, his white,
strained face partly hidden by the abundant display
of mustache and eyebrow. People whispered softly
how handsome he looked, and some suggested that
he was not so stout as when they had last seen him,
ten years before. His stay in a foreign land must
have done him good. One woman went so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to tell her daughter that he was far more distinguished-looking
than she had ever thought he could
become, but it was wonderful what a stay in a foreign
land would do to improve a person.</p>

<p>The music stole onward; and slowly, gracefully,
like the opening of buds into flowers, the bridal party
inched along up the middle aisle until at last the
bride in all the mystery of her white veil arrived,
and all the maidens in their flowers and many colored
gauzes were suitably disposed about her.</p>

<p>The feeble old man on whose arm the bride had
leaned as she came up the aisle dropped out of the
procession, melting into one of the front seats, and
Gordon found himself standing beside the bride.
He felt sure there must be something wrong about
it, and looked at his young guide with an attempt
to change places with him, but the man named Jefferson
held him in place with a warning eye. “You’re
all right. Just stay where you are,” he whispered
softly, and Gordon stayed, reflecting on the strange
fashions of weddings, and wondering why he had
never before taken notice of just how a wedding
party came in and stood and got out again. If he
was only out of this how glad he would be. It
seemed one had to be a pretty all-around man to be
a member of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>The organ had hushed its voice to a sort of exultant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
sobbing, filled with dreams of flowers and joys,
and hints of sorrow; and the minister in a voice
both impressive and musical began the ceremony.
Gordon stood doggedly and wondered if that really
was one eyebrow coming down over his eye, or only
a drop of perspiration.</p>

<p>Another full second passed, and he decided that
if he ever got out of this situation alive he would
never, no, never, no, <i>never</i>, get married himself.</p>

<p>During the next second that crawled by he
became supremely conscious of the creature in white
by his side. A desire possessed him to look at her
and see if she were like Julia Bentley. It was like
a nightmare haunting his dreams that she <i>was</i> Julia
Bentley somehow transported to New York and
being married to him willy-nilly. He could not
shake it off, and the other eyebrow began to feel
shaky. He was sure it was sailing down over his
eye. If he only dared press its adhesive lining a
little tighter to his flesh!</p>

<p>Some time during the situation there came a
prayer, interminable to his excited imagination, as
all the other ceremonies.</p>

<p>Under cover of the hush and the supposedly
bowed heads, Gordon turned desperately toward the
bride. He must see her and drive this phantasm
from his brain. He turned, half expecting to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Julia’s tall, handsome form, though telling himself
he was a fool, and wondering why he so dreaded
the idea. Then his gaze was held fascinated.</p>

<p>She was a little creature, slender and young and
very beautiful, with a beauty which a deathly pallor
only enhanced. Her face was delicately cut, and
set in a frame of fine dark hair, the whole made
most exquisite by the mist of white tulle that
breathed itself about her like real mist over a flower.
But the lovely head drooped, the coral lips had a
look of unutterable sadness, and the long lashes
swept over white cheeks. He could not take his
eyes from her now that he had looked. How lovely,
and how fitting for the delightful youth by his side!
Now that he thought of it she was like him, only
smaller and more delicate, of course. A sudden
fierce, ridiculous feeling of envy filled Gordon’s
heart. Why couldn’t he have known and loved a
girl like that? Why had Julia Bentley been forever
in his pathway as the girl laid out for his choice?</p>

<p>He looked at her with such intensity that a couple
of dear old sisters who listened to the prayer with
their eyes wide open, whispered one to the other:
“Just see him look at her! How he must love her!
Wasn’t it beautiful that he should come right from
the steamer to the church and never see her till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
now, for the first time in ten long years. It’s so
romantic!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” whispered the other; “and I believe
it’ll last. He looks at her that way. Only I do
dislike that way of arranging the hair on his face.
But then it’s foreign I suppose. He’ll probably get
over it if they stay in this country.”</p>

<p>A severe old lady in the seat in front turned a
reprimanding chin toward them and they subsided.
Still Gordon continued to gaze.</p>

<p>Then the bride became aware of his look, raised
her eyes, and—they were full of tears!</p>

<p>They gave him one reproachful glance that shot
through his soul like a sword, and her lashes
drooped again. By some mysterious control over
the law of gravity, the tears remained unshed, and
the man’s gaze was turned aside; but that look had
done its mighty work.</p>

<p>All the experiences of the day rushed over him
and seemed to culminate in that one look. It was
as if the reproach of all things had come upon him.
The hurt in the white dog’s eyes had touched him,
the perfect courage in the appeal of the child’s eyes
had called forth his deepest sympathy, but the tears
of this exquisite woman wrung his heart. He saw
now that the appeal of the dog and the child had
been the opening wedge for the look of a woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
which tore self from him and flung it at her feet
for her to walk upon; and when the prayer was
ended he found that he was trembling.</p>

<p>He looked vindictively at the innocent youth
beside him, as the soft rustle of the audience and
the little breath of relief from the bridal party
betokened the next stage in the ceremony. What
had this innocent-looking youth done to cause tears
in those lovely eyes? Was she marrying him against
her will? He was only a boy, anyway. What right
had he to suppose he could care for a delicate creature
like that? He was making her cry already, and
he seemed to be utterly unconscious of it. What
could be the matter? Gordon felt a desire to kick
him.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that inadvertently <i>he</i>
might have been the cause of her tears; he, supposedly
the best man, who had been late, and held
up the wedding no knowing how long. Of course
it wasn’t really his fault; but by proxy it was, for
he now was masquerading as that unlucky best man,
and she was very likely reproaching him for what
she supposed was his stupidity. He had heard that
women cried sometimes from vexation, disappointment
or excitement.</p>

<p>Yet in his heart of hearts he could not set those
tears, that look, down to so trivial a cause. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
had reached his very soul, and he felt there was
something deeper there than mere vexation. There
had been bitter reproach for a deep wrong done.
The glance had told him that. All the manhood in
him rose to defend her against whoever had hurt
her. He longed to get one more look into her eyes
to make quite sure; and then, if there was still
appeal there, his soul must answer it.</p>

<p>For the moment his commission, his ridiculous
situation, the real peril to his life and trust, were
forgotten.</p>

<p>The man Jefferson had produced a ring and was
nudging him. It appeared that the best man had
some part to play with that ring. He dimly remembered
somewhere hearing that the best man must
hand the ring to the bridegroom at the proper moment,
but it was absurd for them to go through the
farce of doing that when the bridegroom already
held the golden circlet in his fingers! Why did he
not step up like a man and put it upon the outstretched
hand; that little white hand just in front
of him there, so timidly held out with its glove
fingers tucked back, like a dove crept out from its
covert unwillingly?</p>

<p>But that Jefferson-man still held out the ring
stupidly to him, and evidently expected him to take
it. Silly youth! There was nothing for it but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
take it and hand it back, of course. He must do
as he was told and hasten that awful ceremony to
its interminable close. He took the ring and held
it out, but the young man did not take it again.
Instead he whispered, “Put it on her finger!”</p>

<p>Gordon frowned. Could he be hearing aright?
Why didn’t the fellow put the ring on his own
bride? If he were being married, he would knock
any man down that dared to put his wife’s wedding
ring on for him. Could that be the silly custom now,
to have the best man put the bride’s ring on? How
unutterably out of place! But he must not make
a scene, of course.</p>

<p>The little timid hand, so slender and white, came
a shade nearer as if to help, and the ring finger
separated itself from the others.</p>

<p>He looked at the smooth circlet. It seemed too
tiny for any woman’s finger. Then, reverently, he
slipped it on, with a strange, inexpressible longing
to touch the little hand. While he was thinking
himself all kinds of a fool, and was enjoying one
of his intermittent visions of Julia Bentley’s expressive
countenance interpolated on the present
scene, a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>There had been some low murmurs and motions
which he had not noticed because he thought his
part of this very uncomfortable affair was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
concluded, when, lo and behold, the minister and
the young man by his side both began fumbling
for his hand, and among them they managed to
bring it into position and place in its astonished
grasp the little timid hand that he had just crowned
with its ring.</p>

<p>As his fingers closed over the bride’s hand, there
was such reverence, such tenderness in his touch
that the girl’s eyes were raised once more to his
face, this time with the conquered tears in retreat,
but all the pain and appeal still there. He looked
and involuntarily he pressed her hand the closer,
as if to promise aforetime whatever she would
ask. Then, with her hand in his, and with the realization
that they two were detached as it were from
the rest of the wedding party, standing in a little
centre of their own, his senses came back to him,
and he perceived as in a flash of understanding that
it was <i>they</i> who were being married!</p>

<p>There had been some terrible, unexplainable mistake,
and he was stupidly standing in another man’s
place, taking life vows upon himself! The thing
had passed from an adventure of little moment into
a matter of a life-tragedy, two life-tragedies perhaps!
What should he do?</p>

<p>With the question came the words, “I pronounce
you husband and wife,” and “let no man put
asunder.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> had he done? Was it some great unnamed,
unheard-of crime he had unconsciously committed?
Could anyone understand or excuse such
asinine stupidity? Could he ever hold up his head
again, though he fled to the most distant part of the
globe? Was there nothing that could save the situation?
Now, before they left the church, could he
not declare the truth, and set things right, undo the
words that had been spoken in the presence of all
these witnesses, and send out to find the real bridegroom?
Surely neither law nor gospel could endorse
a bond made in the ignorance of either participant.
It would, of course, be a terrible thing
for the bride, but better now than later. Besides,
he was pledged by that hand-clasp to answer the
appeal in her eyes and protect her. This, then, was
what it had meant!</p>

<p>But his commission! What of that? “A matter
of life and death!” Ah! but this was <i>more</i> than
life or death!</p>

<p>While these rapid thoughts were flashing
through his brain, the benediction was being pronounced,
and with the last word the organ pealed
forth its triumphant lay. The audience stirred excitedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
anticipating the final view of the wedding
procession.</p>

<p>The bride turned to take her bouquet from the
maid of honor, and the movement broke the spell
under which Gordon had been held.</p>

<p>He turned to the young man by his side and
spoke hurriedly in a low tone.</p>

<p>“An awful mistake has been made,” he said,
and the organ drowned everything but the word
“mistake.” “I don’t know what to do,” he went
on. But young Jefferson hastened to reassure him
joyously:</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, old chap. Nobody noticed
that hitch about the ring. It was only a second.
Everything went off slick. You haven’t anything
more to do now but take my sister out. Look alive,
there! She looks as if she might be going to faint!
She hasn’t been a bit well all day! Steady her,
quick, can’t you? She’ll stick it out till she gets to
the air, but hurry, for goodness’ sake!”</p>

<p>Gordon turned in alarm. Already the frail
white bride had a claim on him. His first duty
was to get her out of this crowd. Perhaps, after all,
she had discovered that he was not the right man,
and that was the meaning of her tears and appeal.
Yet she had held her own and allowed things to
go through to the finish, and perhaps he had no right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to reveal to the assembled multitudes what she evidently
wanted kept quiet. He must wait till he could
ask her. He must do as this other man said—this—this
brother of hers—who was of course the best
man. Oh, fool, and blind! Why had he not understood
at the beginning and got himself out of this
fix before it was too late? And what should he do
when he reached the door? How could he ever
explain? His commission! He dared not breathe
a word of that? What explanation could he possibly
offer for his—his—yes——his <i>criminal</i> conduct?
Why, no such thing was ever heard of in the history
of mankind as that which had happened to him.
From start to finish it was—it—was—— He could
not think of words to express what it was.</p>

<p>He was by this time meandering jerkily down
the aisle, attempting to keep time to the music and
look the part that she evidently expected him to
play, but his eyes were upon her face, which was
whiter now and, if possible, lovelier, than before.</p>

<p>“Oh, just see how devoted he is,” murmured
the eldest of the two dear old sisters, and he caught
the sense of her words as he passed, and wondered.
Then, immediately before him, retreating backward
down the aisle with terrible eyes of scorn upon him,
he seemed to feel the presence of Miss Julia Bentley
leading onward toward the church door; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
would not take his eyes from that sweet, sad face
of the white bride on his arm to look. He somehow
knew that if he could hold out until he reached that
door without looking up, her power over him would
be exorcised forever.</p>

<p>Out into the vacant vestibule, under the tented
canopy, alone together for the moment, he felt her
gentle weight grow heavy on his arm, and knew her
footsteps were lagging. Instinctively, lest others
should gather around them, he almost lifted her and
bore her down the carpeted steps, through the covered
pathway, to the luxurious motor-car waiting
with open door, and placed her on the cushions.
Some one closed the car door and almost immediately
they were in motion.</p>

<p>She settled back with a half sigh, as if she could
not have borne one instant more of strain, then sitting
opposite he adjusted the window to give her
air. She seemed grateful but said nothing. Her
eyes were closed wearily, and the whole droop of
her figure showed utter exhaustion. It seemed a
desecration to speak to her, yet he must have some
kind of an understanding before they reached their
destination.</p>

<p>“An explanation is due to you——” he began,
without knowing just what he was going to say,
but she put out her hand with a weary protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Oh, please don’t!” she pleaded. “I know—the
boat was late! It doesn’t matter in the least.”</p>

<p>He sat back appalled! She did not herself know
then that she had married the wrong man!</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she moaned. “I don’t want to
understand. Nothing can change things. Only, let
me be quiet till we get to the house, or I never can
go through with the rest of it.”</p>

<p>Her words ended with almost a sob, and he sat
silent for an instant, with a mingling of emotions,
uppermost of which was a desire to take the little,
white, shrinking girl into his arms and comfort her,
“Nothing can change things!” That sounded as
though she did know but thought it too late to undo
the great mistake now that it had been made. He
must let her know that he had not understood until
the ceremony was over. While he sat helplessly
looking at her in the dimness of the car where
she looked so small and sad and misty huddled beside
her great bouquet, she opened her eyes and
looked at him. She seemed to understand that he
was about to speak again. By the great arc light
they were passing he saw there were tears in her
eyes again, and her voice held a child-like pleading
as she uttered one word:</p>

<p>“Don’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>It hurt him like a knife, he knew not why. But
he could not resist the appeal. Duty or no duty, he
could not disobey her command.</p>

<p>“Very well.” He said it quietly, almost tenderly,
and sat back with folded arms. After all,
what explanation could he give her that she would
believe? He might not breathe a word of his commission
or the message. What other reason could
he give for his extraordinary appearance at her
wedding and by her side?</p>

<p>The promise in his voice seemed to give her
relief. She breathed a sigh of relief and closed
her eyes. He must just keep still and have his
eyes open for a chance to escape when the carriage
reached its destination.</p>

<p>Thus silently they threaded through unknown
streets, strange thoughts in the heart of each. The
bride was struggling with her heavy burden, and the
man was trying to think his way out of the maze of
perplexity into which he had unwittingly wandered.
He tried to set his thoughts in order and find out just
what to do. First of all, of course came his commission,
but somehow every time the little white bride
opposite took first place in his mind. Could he serve
both? What <i>would</i> serve both, and what would
serve <i>either</i>? As for himself, he was free to confess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
that there was no room left in the present situation
for even a consideration of his own interests.</p>

<p>Whatever there was of good in him must go now
to set matters right in which he had greatly blundered.
He must do the best he could for the girl
who had so strangely crossed his pathway, and get
back to his commission. But when he tried to realize
the importance of his commission and set it over
against the interests of the girl-bride, his mind became
confused. What should he do! He could not
think of slipping away and leaving her without further
words, even if an opportunity offered itself.
Perhaps he was wrong. Doubtless his many friends
might tell him so if they were consulted, but he did
not intend to consult them. He intended to see this
troubled soul to some place of safety, and look out
for his commission as best he could afterward.
One thing he did not fully realize, and that was
that Miss Julia Bentley’s vision troubled him no
longer. He was free. There was only one woman
in the whole wide world that gave him any concern,
and that was the little sorrowful creature who sat
opposite to him, and to whom he had just been
married.</p>

<p>Just been married! He! The thought brought
with it a thrill of wonder, and a something else that
was not unpleasant. What if he really had? Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
course he had not. Of course such a thing could not
hold good. But what if he had! Just for an instant
he entertained the thought—would he be glad or
sorry? He did not know her, of course, had heard
her speak but a few words, had looked into her face
plainly but once, and yet suppose she were his! His
heart answered the question with a glad bound that
astonished him, and all his former ideas of real
love were swept from his mind in a breath. He
knew that, stranger though she was, he could take
her to his heart; cherish her, love her and bear with
her, as he never could have done Julia Bentley.
Then all at once he realized that he was allowing his
thoughts to dwell upon a woman who by all that was
holy belonged to another man, and that other man
would doubtless soon be the one with whom he
would have to deal. He would soon be face to face
with a new phase of the situation and he must prepare
himself to meet it. What was he going to do?
Should he plan to escape from the opposite door
of the automobile while the bride was being assisted
from her seat? No, he could not, for he would be
expected to get out first and help her out. Besides,
there would be too many around, and he could not
possibly get away. But, greater than any such
reason, the thing that held him bound was the look
in her eyes through the tears. He simply could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
leave her until he knew that she no longer needed
him. And yet there was his commission! Well,
he must see her in the hands of those who would
care for her at least. So much he had done even
for the white dog, and then, too, surely she was
worth as many minutes of his time as he had been
compelled to give to the injured child of the streets.
If he only could explain to her now!</p>

<p>The thought of his message, with its terrible
significance, safe in his possession, sent shivers of
anxiety through his frame! Suppose he should be
caught, and it taken from him, all on account of this
most impossible incident! What scorn, what contumely,
would be his! How could he ever explain
to his chief? Would anybody living believe that a
man in his senses could be married to a stranger
before a whole church full of people, and not know
he was being married until the deed was done—and
then not do anything about it after it was done?
That was what he was doing now this very minute.
He ought to be explaining something somehow to
that poor little creature in the shadow of the carriage.
Perhaps in some way it might relieve her
sorrow if he did, and yet when he looked at her
and tried to speak his mouth was hopelessly closed.
He might not tell her anything!</p>

<p>He gradually sifted his immediate actions down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
to two necessities; to get his companion to a safe
place where her friends could care for her, and to
make his escape as soon and as swiftly as possible.
It was awful to run and leave her without telling
her anything about it; when she evidently believed
him to be the man she had promised and intended to
marry; but the real bridegroom would surely turn
up soon somehow and make matters right. Anyhow,
it was the least he could do to take himself out
of her way, and to get his trust to its owners at once.</p>

<p>The car halted suddenly before a brightly lighted
mansion, whose tented entrance effectually shut out
the gaze of alien eyes, and made the transit from
car to domicile entirely private. There was no
opportunity here to disappear. The sidewalk and
road were black with curious onlookers. He stepped
from the car first and helped the lady out. He bore
her heavy bouquet because she looked literally too
frail to carry it further herself.</p>

<p>In the doorway she was surrounded by a bevy
of servants, foremost among whom her old nurse
claimed the privilege of greeting her with tears and
smiles and many “Miss-Celia-my-dears,” and Gordon
stood for the instant entranced, watching the
sweet play of loving kindness in the face of the pale
little bride. As soon as he could lay down those
flowers inconspicuously he would be on the alert for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
a way of escape. It surely would be found through
some back or side entrance of the house.</p>

<p>But even as the thought came to him the old
nurse stepped back to let the other servants greet
the bride with stiff bows and embarrassed words of
blessing, and he felt a hand laid heavily on his arm.</p>

<p>He started as he turned, thinking instantly again
of his commission and expecting to see a policeman
in uniform by his side, but it was only the old nurse,
with tears of devotion still in her faded eyes.</p>

<p>“Mister George, ye hevn’t forgot me, hev ye?”
she asked, earnestly. “You usen’t to like me verra
well, I mind, but ye was awful for the teasin’ an’ I
was always for my Miss Celie! But bygones is bygones
now an’ I wish ye well. Yer growed a man,
an’ I know ye must be worthy o’ her, or she’d never
hev consented to take ye. Yev got a gude wife an’
no mistake, an’ I know ye’ll be the happiest man
alive. Ye won’t hold it against me, Mister George,
that I used to tell yer uncle on your masterful tricks,
will ye? You mind I was only carin’ fer my baby
girl, an’ ye were but a boy.”</p>

<p>She paused as if expecting an answer, and Gordon
embarrassedly assured her that he would never
think of holding so trifling a matter against her.
He cast a look of reverent admiration and tenderness
toward the beautiful girl who was smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
on her loyal subjects like a queen, roused from her
sorrow to give joy to others; and even her old nurse
was satisfied.</p>

<p>“Ah, ye luve her, Mister George, don’t ye?”
the nurse questioned. “I don’t wonder. Everybody
what lays eyes on her luves her. She’s that
dear——” here the tears got the better of the good
woman for an instant and she forgot herself and
pulled at the skirt of her new black dress thinking
it was an apron, and wishing to wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Gordon found his lips uttering
strange words, without his own apparent consent,
as if his heart had suddenly taken things in hand
and determined to do as it pleased without consulting
his judgment.</p>

<p>“Yes, I love her,” he was saying, and to his
amazement he found that the words were true.</p>

<p>This discovery made matters still more complicated.</p>

<p>“Then ye’ll promise me something, Mister
George, won’t ye?” said the nurse eagerly, her tears
having their own way down her rosy anxious face.
“Ye’ll promise me never to make her feel bad any
more? She’s cried a lot these last three months, an’
nobody knows but me. She could hide it from them
all but her old nurse that has loved her so long.
But she’s been that sorrowful, enough fer a whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
lifetime. Promise that ye’ll do all in yer power to
make her happy always.”</p>

<p>“I will do all in my power to make her happy,”
he said, solemnly, as if he were uttering a vow, and
wondered how short-lived that power was to be.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wedding party had arrived in full force
now. Carriages and automobiles were unloading;
gay voices and laughter filled the house. The servants
disappeared to their places, and the white
bride, with only a motioning look toward Gordon,
led the way to the place where they were to stand
under an arch of roses, lilies and palms, in a room
hung from the ceiling with drooping ferns and white
carnations on invisible threads of silver wire, until
it all seemed like a fairy dream.</p>

<p>Gordon had no choice but to follow, as his way
was blocked by the incoming guests, and he foresaw
that his exit would have to be made from some other
door than the front if he were to escape yet awhile.
As he stepped into the mystery of the flower-scented
room where his lady led the way, he was conscious
of a feeling of transition from the world of ordinary
things into one of wonder, beauty and mysterious
joy; but all the time he knew he was an impostor,
who had no right in that silver-threaded bower.</p>

<p>Yet there he stood bowing, shaking hands, and
smirking behind his false mustache, which threatened
every minute to betray him.</p>

<p>People told him he was looking well, and congratulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
him on his bride. Some said he was
stouter than when he left the country, and some
said he was thinner. They asked him questions
about relatives and friends living and dead, and he
ran constant risk of getting into hopeless difficulties.
His only safety was in smiling, and saying
very little; seeming not to hear some questions, and
answering others with another question. It was not
so hard after he got started, because there were so
many people, and they kept coming close upon one
another, so no one had much time to talk. Then
supper with its formalities was got through with
somehow, though to Gordon, with his already satisfied
appetite and his hampering mustache, it seemed
an endless ordeal.</p>

<p>“Jeff,” as they all called him, was everywhere,
attending to everything, and he slipped up to the
unwilling bridegroom just as he was having to
answer a very difficult question about the lateness of
his vessel, and the kind of passage they had experienced
in crossing. By this time Gordon had discovered
that he was supposed to have been ten years
abroad, and his steamer had been late in landing, but
where he came from or what he had been doing over
there were still to be found out; and it was extremely
puzzling to be asked from what port he had
sailed, and how he came to be there when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
been supposed to have been in St. Petersburg but
the week before? His state of mind was anything
but enviable. Besides all this, Gordon was just reflecting
that the last he had seen of his hat and coat
was in the church. What had become of them, and
how could he go to the station without a hat? Then
opportunely “Jeff” arrived.</p>

<p>“Your train leaves at ten three,” he said in a
low, business-like tone, as if he enjoyed the importance
of having made all the arrangements. “I’ve
secured the stateroom as you cabled me to do, and
here are the tickets and checks. The trunks are
down there all checked. Celia didn’t want any nonsense
about their being tied up with white ribbon.
She hates all that. We’ve arranged for you to slip
out by the fire-escape and down through the back
yard of the next neighbor, where a motor, just a
plain regular one from the station, will be waiting
around the corner in the shadow. Celia knows
where it is. None of the party will know you are
gone until you are well under way. The car they
think you will take is being elaborately adorned with
white at the front door now, but you won’t have
any trouble about it. I’ve fixed everything up.
Your coat and hat are out on the fire-escape, and as
soon as Celia’s ready I’ll show you the way.”</p>

<p>Gordon thanked him. There was nothing else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
to do, but his countenance grew blank. Was there,
then, to be no escape? Must he actually take another
man’s bride with him in order to get away?
And how was he to get away from her? Where
was the real bridegroom and why did he not appear
upon the scene? And yet what complications that
might bring up. He began to look wildly about
for a chance to flee at once, for how could he possibly
run away with a bride on his hands? If only
some one were going with them to the station he
could slip away with a clear conscience, leaving her
in good hands, but to leave her alone, ill, and distressed
was out of the question. He had rid himself
of a lonely dog and a suffering child, though
it gave him anguish to do the deed, but leave this
lovely woman for whom he at least appeared to have
become responsible, he could not, until he was sure
she would come to no harm through him.</p>

<p>“Don’t let anything hinder you! Don’t let
anything hinder you!”</p>

<p>It appeared that this refrain had not ceased for
an instant since it began, but had chimed its changes
through music, ceremony, prayer and reception without
interruption. It acted like a goad upon his conscience
now. He must do something that would
set him free to go back to Washington. An inspiration
came to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Wouldn’t you like to go to the station with
us?” he asked the young man, “I am sure your
sister would like to have you.”</p>

<p>The boy’s face lit up joyfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t you mind? I’d like it awfully,
and—if it’s all the same to you, I wish Mother could
go too. It’s the first time Celia and she were ever
separated, and I know she hates it fiercely to have
to say good-by with the house full of folks this
way. But she doesn’t expect it of course, and
really it isn’t fair to you, when you haven’t seen
Celia alone yet, and it’s your wedding trip——”</p>

<p>“There will be plenty of time for us,” said the
compulsory bridegroom graciously, and felt as if
he had perjured himself. It was not in his nature
to enjoy a serious masquerade of this kind.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to have you both come,” he
added earnestly. “I really want you. Tell your
mother.”</p>

<p>The boy grasped his hand impulsively:</p>

<p>“I say,” said he, “you’re all right! I don’t
mind confessing that I’ve hated the very thought of
you for a whole three months, ever since Celia told
us she had promised to marry you. You see, I never
really knew you when I was a little chap, but I didn’t
used to like you. I took an awful scunner to you
for some reason. I suppose kids often take irrational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
dislikes like that. But ever since I’ve
laid eyes on you to-night, I’ve liked you all the way
through. I like your eyes. It isn’t a bit as I thought
I remembered you. I used to think your eyes had a
sort of deceitful look. Awful to tell you, isn’t it?
But I felt as if I wanted to have it off my conscience,
for I see now you’re nothing of the kind. You’ve
got the honestest eyes I ever saw on a man, and
I’d stake my last cent that you wouldn’t cheat a
church mouse. You’re true as steel, and I’m mighty
glad you’re my brother-in-law. I know you’ll be
good to Celia.”</p>

<p>The slow color mounted under his disguise until
it reached Gordon’s burnished brown hair. His eyes
were honest eyes. They had always been so—until
to-day. Into what a world of deceit he had entered!
How he would like to make a clean breast of it all
to this nice, frank boy; but he must not! for there
was his trust! For an instant he was on the point
of trying to explain that he was not the true bridegroom,
and getting young Jefferson to help him to
set matters right, but an influx of newly arrived
guests broke in upon their privacy, and he could
only press the boy’s hand and say in embarrassed
tones:</p>

<p>“Thank you! I shall try to be worthy of your
good opinion hereafter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>It was over at last, and the bride slipped from
his side to prepare for the journey. He looked hastily
around, feeling that his very first opportunity
had come for making an escape. If an open window
had presented itself, he would have vaulted through,
trusting to luck and his heels to get away, but there
was no window, and every door was blocked by staring,
admiring, smirking people. He bethought himself
of the fire-escape where waited his hat and coat,
and wondered if he could find it.</p>

<p>With smiling apologies, he broke away from
those around him, murmuring something about being
needed, and worked his way firmly but steadily
toward the stairs and thence to the back halls. Coming
at last upon an open window, he slipped through,
his heart beating wildly. He thought for a second
that he was there ahead of the others; but a dark
form loomed ahead and he perceived some one coming
up from outside. Another second, and he saw
it was his newly acquired brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“Say, this is great!” was his greeting. “How
did you manage to find your way up alone? I was
just coming down after you. I wanted to leave you
there till the last minute so no one would suspect,
but now you are here we can hustle off at once.
I just took Mother and Celia down. It was pretty
stiff for Mother to climb down, for she was a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
bit afraid, but she was game all right, and she was so
pleased to go. They’re waiting for us down there
in the court. Here, let me help you with your overcoat.
Now I’ll pull down this window, so no one
will suspect us and follow. That’s all right now,
come on! You go ahead. Just hold on to the railing
and go slow. I’ll keep close to you. I know
the way in my sleep. I’ve played fire here many a
year, and could climb down in my sleep.”</p>

<p>Gordon found himself wishing that this delightful
brother-in-law were really his. There was evidently
to be no opportunity of escape here. He
meditated making a dash and getting away in the
dark when they should reach the foot of the stairs;
much as he hated to leave that way, he felt he must
do so if there was any chance for him at all; but
when they reached the ground he saw that was hopeless.
The car that was to take them to the station
was drawn up close to the spot, and the chauffeur
stood beside it.</p>

<p>“Your mother says fer you to hurry, Mister
Jefferson,” he called in a sepulchral tone. “They’re
coming out around the block to watch. Get in as
quick as you can.”</p>

<p>The burly chauffeur stood below Gordon, helped
him to alight on his feet from the fire-escape, and
hustled him into the darkness of the conveyance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>They were very quiet until they had left the
dark court and were speeding away down the avenue.
Then the bride’s mother laid two gentle hands upon
Gordon’s, leaning across from her seat to do so,
and said:</p>

<p>“My son, I shall never forget this of you, never!
It was dear of you to give me this last few minutes
with my darling!”</p>

<p>Gordon, deeply touched and much put to it for
words, mumbled something about being very glad
to have her, and Jefferson relieved the situation by
pouring forth a volume of information and questions,
fortunately not pausing long enough to have
the latter answered. The bride sat with one hand
clasped in her mother’s, and said not a word. Gordon
was haunted by the thought of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>There was little opportunity for thinking, but
Gordon made a hasty plan. He decided to get his
party all out to the train and then remember his suit-case,
which he had left checked in the station. Jefferson
would probably insist upon going for it but
he would insist more strenuously that the brother
and sister would want to have this last minute together.
Then he could get away in the crowd and
disappear, coming later for his suit-case perhaps,
or sending a porter from his own train for it. The
only drawback to this arrangement was that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
seemed a dishonorable way to leave these people
who would in the nature of things be left in a most
trying position by his disappearance, especially the
sad little bride. But it could not be helped, and his
staying would only complicate things still further,
for he would have to explain who he was, and that
was practically impossible on account of his commission.
It would not do to run risks with himself
until his mission was accomplished and his message
delivered. After that he could confess and make
whatever reparation a man in his strange position
could render.</p>

<p>The plan worked very well. The brother of
course eagerly urged that he be allowed to go back
for the suit-case, but Gordon, with well-feigned
thoughtfulness, said in a low tone:</p>

<p>“Your sister will want you for a minute all to
herself.”</p>

<p>A tender look came into the boy’s eyes, and he
turned back smiling to the stateroom where his
mother and sister were having a wordless farewell.
Gordon jumped from the train and sprinted down
the platform, feeling meaner than he ever remembered
to have felt in his whole life, and with a
strange heaviness about his heart. He forgot for
the moment that there was need for him to be on
his guard against possible detectives sent by Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Holman. Even the importance of the message he
carried seemed to weigh less, now that he was free.
His feet had a strange unwillingness to hurry, and
without a constant pressure of the will would have
lagged in spite of him. His heart wanted to let
suit-case and commission and everything else go to
the winds and take him back to the stateroom where
he had left his sorrowful bride of an hour. She
was not his, and he might not go, but he knew that
he would never be the same hereafter. He would
always be wondering where she was, wishing he
could have saved her from whatever troubled her;
wishing she were his bride, and not another’s.</p>

<p>He passed back through the station gate, and a
man in evening clothes eyed him sharply. He
fancied he saw a resemblance to one of the men
at the Holman dinner-table, but he dared not look
again lest a glance should cost him recognition. He
wondered blindly which way he should take, and if
it would be safe to risk going at once to the checking
window, or whether he ought to go in hiding until
he was sure young Jefferson would no longer look
for him. Then a hand touched his shoulder and a
voice that was strangely welcome shouted:</p>

<p>“This way, George! The checking place is over
to the right!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>He turned and there stood Jefferson, smiling
and panting:</p>

<p>“You see, the little mother had something to
say to Celia alone, so I saw I was <i>de trop</i>, and
thought I better come with you,” he declared as soon
as he could get his breath.</p>

<p>“Gee, but you can run!” added the panting
youth. “What’s the hurry? It’s ten whole minutes
before the train leaves. I couldn’t waste all that
time kicking my heels on the platform, when I
might be enjoying my new brother-in-law’s company.
I say, are you really going to live permanently
in Chicago? I do wish you’d decide to come
back to New York. Mother’ll miss Celia no end.
I don’t know how she’s going to stand it.”</p>

<p>Walking airily by Gordon’s side, he talked, apparently
not noticing the sudden start and look of
mingled anxiety and relief that overspread his
brother-in-law’s countenance. Then another man
walked by them and turning looked in their faces.
Gordon was sure this was the thick-set man from
Holman’s. He was eying Gordon keenly. Suddenly
all other questions stepped into the background, and
the only immediate matter that concerned him was
his message, to get it safely to its destination. With
real relief he saw that this had been his greatest
concern all the time, underneath all hindrances, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
that there had not been at any moment any escape
from the crowding circumstances other than that he
had taken, step by step. If he had been beset by
thieves and blackguards, and thrown into prison for
a time he would not have felt shame at the delay, for
those things he could not help. He saw with new
illumination that there was no more shame to him
from these trivial and peculiar circumstances with
which he had been hemmed in since his start to New
York than if he had been checked by any more tragic
obstacles. His only real misgiving was about his
marriage. Somehow it seemed his fault, and he
felt there ought to be some way to confess his part
at once—but how—without putting his message in
jeopardy—for no one would believe unless they
knew all.</p>

<p>But the time of danger was at hand, he plainly
saw. The man whom he dared not look closely at
had turned again and was walking parallel to them,
glancing now and again keenly in their direction.
He was watching Gordon furtively; not a motion
escaped him.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s delay at the checking
counter while the attendant searched for the suit-case,
and Gordon was convinced that the man had
stopped a few steps away merely for the purpose
of watching him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>He dared not look around or notice the man,
but he was sure he followed them back to the train.
He felt his presence as clearly as if he had been
able to see through the back of his head.</p>

<p>But Gordon was cool and collected now. It was
as if the experiences of the last two hours, with their
embarrassing predicaments, had been wiped off the
calendar, and he were back at the moment when he
left the Holman house. He knew as well as if he
had watched them follow him that they had discovered
his—theft—treachery—whatever it ought to
be called—and he was being searched for; and because
of what was at stake those men would track
him to death if they could. But he knew also that
his disguise and his companion were for the moment
puzzling this sleuth-hound.</p>

<p>This was probably not the only watcher about
the station. There were detectives, too, perhaps,
hired hastily, and all too ready to seize a suspect.</p>

<p>He marvelled that he could walk so deliberately,
swinging his suit-case in his gloved hand at so
momentous a time. He smiled and talked easily
with the pleasant fellow who walked by his side,
and answered his questions with very little idea of
what he was saying; making promises which his
heart would like to keep, but which he now saw no
way of making good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Thus they entered the train and came to the car
where the bride and her mother waited. There were
tears on the face of the girl, and she turned to the
window to hide them. Gordon’s eyes followed her
wistfully, and down through the double glass, unnoticed
by her absent gaze, he saw the face of the
man who had followed them, sharply watching him.</p>

<p>Realizing that his hat was a partial disguise, he
kept it on in spite of the presence of the ladies.
The color rose in his cheeks that he had to seem so
discourteous, but, to cover his embarrassment, he
insisted that he be allowed to take the elder lady to
the platform, as it really was almost time for the
train to start, and so he went deliberately out to act
the part of bridegroom in the face of his recognized
foe.</p>

<p>The mother and Gordon stood for a moment on
the vestibule platform, while Jefferson bade his sister
good-by and tried to soothe her distress at parting
from her mother.</p>

<p>“He’s all right, Celie, indeed he is,” said the
young fellow caressingly, laying his hand upon his
sister’s bowed head. “He’s going to be awfully
good to you; he cares a lot for you, and he’s promised
to do all sorts of nice things. He says he’ll
bring you back soon, and he would never stand in
the way of your being with us a lot. He did indeed!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
What do you think of that? Isn’t it quite different
from what you thought he would say? He doesn’t
seem to think he’s got to spend the rest of his days
in Chicago either. He says there might something
turn up that would make it possible for him to
change all his plans. Isn’t that great?”</p>

<p>Celia tried to look up and smile through her
tears, while the man outside studied the situation
a moment in perplexity and then strolled slowly back
to watch Gordon and the elder woman.</p>

<p>“You will be good to my little girl,” he heard
the woman’s voice pleading. “She has always been
guarded, and she will miss us all, even though she
has you.” The voice went through Gordon like a
knife. To stand much more of this and not denounce
himself for a blackguard would be impossible.
Neither could he keep his hat on in the presence
of this wonderful motherhood, a motherhood
that appealed to him all the more that he had never
known a mother of his own, and had always longed
for one.</p>

<p>He put up his hand and lifted his hat slightly,
guarding as much as possible his own face from
the view of the man on the station platform, who
was still walking deliberately, considerately, up and
down, often passing near enough to hear what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
were saying. In this reverent attitude, Gordon
said, as though he were uttering a sacred vow:</p>

<p>“I will guard her as if she were—as if I were—as
if I were—<i>you</i>”—then he paused a moment and
added solemnly, tenderly—“Mother!”</p>

<p>He wondered if it were not desecration to utter
such words when all the time he was utterly unable
to perform them in the way in which the mother
meant. “Impostor!” was the word which rang in
his ears now. The clamor about being hindered had
ceased, for he was doing his best, and not letting
even a woman’s happiness stand in the way of his
duty.</p>

<p>Yet his heart had dictated the words he had
spoken, while his mind and judgment were busy
with his perilous position. He could not gainsay
his heart, for he felt that in every way he could
he would guard and care for the girl who was to be
in his keeping at least for a few minutes until he
could contrive some way to get her back to her
friends without him.</p>

<p>The whistle of the train was sounding now, and
the brakemen were shouting, “All aboard!”</p>

<p>He helped the frail little elderly woman down the
steps, and she reached up her face to kiss him. He
bent and took the caress, the first time that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
woman’s lips had touched his face since he was a
little child.</p>

<p>“Mother, I will not let anything harm her,”
he whispered, and she said:</p>

<p>“My boy, I can trust you!”</p>

<p>Then he put her into the care of her strong
young son, swung upon the train as the wheels
began to move, and hurried back to the bride. On
the platform, walking beside the train, he still saw
the man. Going to the weeping girl, Gordon stooped
over her gently, touched her on the shoulder, and
drew the window shade down. The last face he
saw outside was the face of the baffled man, who
was turning back, but what for? Was he going
to report to others, and would there perhaps be another
stop before they left the city, where officers
or detectives might board the train? He ought to
be ready to get off and run for his life if there was.
There seemed no way but to fee the porter to look
after his companion, and leave her, despicable as
it seemed! Yet his soul of honor told him he could
never do that, no matter what was at stake.</p>

<p>Then, without warning a new situation was
thrust upon him. The bride, who had been standing
with bowed head and with her handkerchief up
to her eyes, just as her brother had left her, tottered
and fell into his arms, limp and white. Instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
all his senses were called into action, and he forgot
the man on the platform, forgot the possible next
stop in the city, and the explanation he had been
about to make to the girl; forgot even the importance
of his mission, and the fact that the train he
was on was headed toward Chicago, instead of
Washington; forgot everything but the fact that the
loveliest girl he had ever seen, with the saddest look
a human face might wear, was lying apparently lifeless
in his arms.</p>

<p>Outside the window the man had turned back
and was now running excitedly along with the train
trying to see into the window; and down the platform,
not ten yards behind, came a frantic man with
English-looking clothes, a heavy mustache and
goatee, shaggy eyebrows, and a sensual face, striding
angrily along as fast as his heavy body would
carry him.</p>

<p>But Gordon saw none of them.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> hours before, the man who was hurling
himself furiously after the rapidly retreating train
had driven calmly through the city, from the pier of
the White Star Line to the apartment of a man
whom he had met abroad, and who had offered him
the use of it during his absence. The rooms were
in the fourth story of a fine apartment house. The
returning exile noted with satisfaction the irreproachable
neighborhood, as he slowly descended
from the carriage, paid his fee, and entered the door,
to present his letter of introduction to the janitor
in charge.</p>

<p>His first act was to open the steamer trunk
which he had brought with him in the cab, and take
therefrom his wedding garments. These he carefully
arranged on folding hangers and hung in the
closet, which was otherwise empty save for a few
boxes piled on the high shelf.</p>

<p>Then he hastened to the telephone and communicated
with his best man, Jefferson Hathaway;
told him the boat was late arriving at the dock, but
that he was here at last; gave him a few directions
concerning errands he would like to have done, and
agreed to be at the church a half-hour earlier than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the time set for the ceremony, to be shown just
what arrangements had been made. He was told
that his bride was feeling very tired and was resting,
and agreed that it would be as well not to disturb
her; they would have time enough to talk afterwards;
there really wasn’t anything to say but what
he had already written. And he would have about
all he could do to get there on time as it was. He
asked if Jefferson had called for the ring he had
ordered and if the carriage would be sent for him in
time and then without formalities closed the interview.
He and Jefferson were not exactly fond of
one another, though Jefferson was the beloved
brother of his bride-to-be.</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and rang for a brandy
and soda to brace himself for the coming ordeal
which was to bind to him a woman whom for years
he had been trying to get in his power and whom
he might have loved if she had not dared to scorn
him for the evil that she knew was in him. At
last he had found a way to subdue her and bring
her with her ample fortune to his feet and he felt
the exultation of the conqueror as he went about his
preparations for the evening.</p>

<p>He made a smug and leisurely toilet, with a
smile of satisfaction upon his flabby face. He was
naturally a selfish person and had always known how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to make other people attend to all bothersome details
for him while he enjoyed himself. He was
quite comfortable and self-complacent as he posed
a moment before the mirror to smooth his mustache
and note how well he was looking. Then he went
to the closet for his coat.</p>

<p>It was most peculiar, the way it happened, but
somehow, as he stepped into that closet to take down
his coat, which hung at the back where the space
was widest, the opening at the wrist of his shirt-sleeve
caught for just an instant in the little knob
of the closet latch. The gold button which held
the cuff to the wristband slipped its hold, and the
man was free almost at once, but the angry twitch
he had made at the slight detention had given the
door an impetus which set it silently moving on its
hinges. (It was characteristic of George Hayne
that he was always impatient of the slightest detention.)
He had scarcely put his hand upon his wedding
coat when a soft steel click, followed by utter
darkness, warned him that his impatience had entrapped
him. He put out his hand and pushed at the
door, but the catch had settled into place. It was a
very strong, neat little catch, and it did its work well.
The man was a prisoner.</p>

<p>At first he was only annoyed, and gave the door
an angry kick or two, as if of course it would presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
release him meekly; but then he bethought
him of his polished wedding shoes, and desisted.
He tried to find a knob and shake the door, but the
only knob was the tiny brass one on the outside of
the catch, and you cannot shake a plain surface
reared up before you. Then he set his massive,
flabby shoulder against the door and pressed with
all his might, till his bulky linen shirt front creaked
with dismay, and his wedding collar wilted limply.
But the door stood like adamant. It was massive,
like the man, but it was not flabby. The wood of
which it was composed had spent its early life in the
open air, drinking only the wine of sunshine and
sparkling air, wet with the dews of heaven, and
exercising against the north blast. It was nothing
for it to hold out against this pillow of a man, who
had been nurtured in the dissipation and folly of
a great city. The door held its own, and if doors
do such things, the face of it must have laughed to
the silent room; and who knows but the room
winked back? It would be but natural that a room
should resent a new occupant in the absence of a
beloved owner.</p>

<p>He was there, safe and fast, in the still dark,
with plenty of time for reflection. And there were
things in his life that called for his reflection. They
had never had him at an advantage before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>In due course of time, having exhausted his
breath and strength in fruitless pushing, and his
vocabulary in foolish curses, he lifted up his voice
and roared. No other word would quite describe
the sound that issued from his mighty throat. But
the city roared placidly below him, and no one
minded him in the least.</p>

<p>He sacrificed the shiny toes of the shoes and
added resounding kicks on the door to the general
hubbub. He changed the roar to a bellow like a
mad bull, but still the silence that succeeded it was
as deep and monotonous as ever. He tried going
to the back of the closet and hurling himself against
the door, but he only hurt his soft muscles with the
effort. Finally he sat down on the floor of the closet.</p>

<p>Now, the janitor’s wife, who occupied an apartment
somewhat overcrowded, had surreptitiously
borrowed the use of this closet the week before, in
order to hang therein her Sunday gown, whose front
breadth was covered with grease-spots, thickly overlaid
with French chalk. The French chalk had done
its work and removed the grease-spots, and now
lay thickly on the floor of the closet, but the imprisoned
bridegroom did not know that, and he sat
down quite naturally to rest from his unusual exertions,
and to reflect on what could be done next.</p>

<p>The immediate present passed rapidly in review.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
He could not afford more than ten minutes to get out
of this hole. He ought to be on the way to the
church at once. There was no knowing what nonsense
Celia might get into her head if he delayed.
He had known her since her childhood, and she had
always scorned him. The hold he had upon her
now was like a rope of sand, but only he knew that.
If he could but knock that old door down! If he
only hadn’t hung up his coat in the closet! If the
man who built the house only hadn’t put such a fool
catch on the door! When he got out he would take
time to chop it off! If only he had a little more
room, and a little more air! It was stifling! Great
beads of perspiration went rolling down his hot
forehead, and his wet collar made a cool band about
his neck. He wondered if he had another clean collar
of that particular style with him. If he <i>only</i>
could get out of this accursed place! Where were
all the people? Why was everything so still? Would
they never come and let him out?</p>

<p>He reflected that he had told the janitor he
would occupy the room with his baggage for two
or three weeks perhaps, but he expected to go away
on a trip this very evening. The janitor would not
think it strange if he did not appear. How would
it be to stay here and die? Horrible thought!</p>

<p>He jumped up from the floor and began his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
howlings and gyrations once more, but soon desisted,
and sat down to be entertained by a panorama of
his past life which is always unpleasantly in evidence
at such times. Fine and clear in the darkness
of the closet stood out the nicely laid scheme of
deviltry by which he had contrived to be at last
within reach of a coveted fortune.</p>

<p>Occasionally would come the frantic thought
that just through this little mishap of a foolish
clothespress catch he might even yet lose it. The
fraud and trickery by which he had an heiress in
his power did not trouble him so much as the thought
of losing her—at least of losing the fortune. He
must have that fortune, for he was deep in debt,
and—but then he would refuse to think, and get up
to batter at his prison door again.</p>

<p>Four hours his prison walls enclosed him, with
inky blackness all around save for a faint glimmer
of light, which marked the well-fitted base of the
door as the night outside drew on. He had lighted
the gas when he began dressing, for the room had
already been filled with shadows, and now, it began
to seem as if that streak of flickering gas light was
the only thing that saved him from losing his mind.</p>

<p>Somewhere from out of the dim shadows a face
evolved itself and gazed at him, a haggard face with
piercing hollow eyes and despair written upon it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
It reproached him with a sin he thought long-forgotten.
He shrank back in horror and the cold perspiration
stood out upon his forehead, for the eyes
were the eyes of the man whose name he had forged
upon a note involving trust money fifteen years before;
and the man, a quiet, kindly, unsuspecting
creature had suffered the penalty in a prison cell until
his death some five years ago.</p>

<p>Sometimes at night in the first years after his
crime, that face had haunted him, appearing at odd
intervals when he was plotting some particularly
shady means of adding to his income, until he had
resolved to turn over a new leaf, and actually gave
up one or two schemes as being too unscrupulous
to be indulged in, thus acquiring a comforting feeling
of being virtuous. But it was long since the
face had come. He had settled it in his mind that
the forgery was merely a patch of wild oats which
he had sown in his youth, something to be regretted
but not too severely blamed for, and thus forgiving
himself he had grown to feel that it was more the
world’s fault for not giving him what he wanted
than his own for putting a harmless old man in
prison. Of the shame that had killed the old man he
knew nothing, nor could have understood. The
actual punishment itself was all that appealed to
him. He was ever one that had to be taught with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the lash, and then only kept straight while it was in
sight.</p>

<p>But the face was very near and vivid here in the
thick darkness. It was like a cell, this closet, bare,
cold, black. The eyes in the gloom seemed to pierce
him with the thought: “This is what you made me
suffer. It is your turn now. <span class="smcap">It is your turn now!</span>”
Nearer and nearer they came looking into his own,
until they saw down into his very soul, his little sinful
soul, and drew back appalled at the littleness
and meanness of what they saw.</p>

<p>Then for the first time in his whole selfish life
George Hayne knew any shame, for the eyes read
forth to him all that they had seen, and how it looked
to them; and beside the tale they told the eyes were
clean of sin and almost glad in spite of suffering
wrongfully.</p>

<p>Closer and thicker grew the air of the small
closet; fiercer grew the rage and shame and horror
of the man incarcerated.</p>

<p>Now, from out the shadows there looked other
eyes, eyes that had never haunted him before; eyes
of victims to whom he had never cast a half a
thought. Eyes of men and women he had robbed
by his artful, gentlemanly craft; eyes of innocent
girls whose wrecked lives had contributed to his
selfish scheme of living; even the great reproachful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
eyes of little children who had looked to him for pity
and found none. Last, above them all were the eyes
of the lovely girl he was to have married.</p>

<p>He had always loved Celia Hathaway more
than he could have loved anyone or anything else
besides himself, and it had eaten into his very being
that he never could make her bow to him; not even
by torture could he bring her to her knees. Stung
by the years of her scorn he had stooped lower and
lower in his methods of dealing with her until he
had come at last to employ the tools of slow torture
to her soul that he might bring low her pride and
put her fortune and her scornful self within his
power. The strength with which she had withheld
him until the time of her surrender had turned his
selfish love into a hate with contemplations of
revenge.</p>

<p>But now her eyes glowed scornfully, wreathed
round with bridal white, and seemed to taunt him
with his foolish defeat at this the last minute before
the final triumph.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the brandy he had taken had gone
to his head. Was he going mad that he could not
get away from all these terrible eyes?</p>

<p>He felt sure he was dying when at last the janitor
came up to the fourth floor on his round of inspection,
noticed the light flaring from the transom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
over the door occupied by the stranger who had
said he was going to leave on a trip almost immediately,
and went in to investigate. The eyes vanished
at his step. The man in the closet lost no
time in making his presence known, and the janitor,
cautiously, and with great deliberation made careful
investigation of the cause and reason for this disturbance
and finally let him out, after having received
promise of reward which never materialized.</p>

<p>The stranger flew to the telephone in frantic
haste, called up the house of his affianced bride,
shouting wildly at the operator for all undue delays,
and when finally he succeeded in getting some one
to the ’phone it was only to be told that neither Mrs.
Hathaway nor her son were there. Were they at
the church? “Oh, no,” the servant answered, “they
came back from the church long ago. There is a
wedding in the house, and a great many people.
They are making so much noise I can’t hear. Speak
louder please!”</p>

<p>He shouted and raved at the servant, asking
futile questions and demanding information, but
the louder he raved the less the servant understood
and finally he hung up the receiver and dashed about
the room like an insane creature, tearing off his
wilted collar, grabbing at another, jerking on his
fine coat, searching vainly for his cuffs, snatching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
his hat and overcoat, and making off down the
stairs; breathlessly, regardless of the demand of the
janitor for the fee of freedom he had been promised.</p>

<p>Out in the street he rushed hither and thither
blindly in search of some conveyance, found a taxicab
at last, and, plunging in, ordered it to go at
once to the Hathaway address.</p>

<p>Arrived there, he presented an enlivening spectacle
to the guests, who were still making merry.
His trousers were covered with French chalk, his
collar had slipped from its confining button in front
and curved gracefully about one fat cheek, his high
hat was a crush indeed, having been rammed down
to his head in his excitement. He talked so fast
and so loud that they thought he was crazy and
tried to put him out, but he shook his fist angrily
in the face of the footman and demanded to know
where Miss Hathaway was? When they told him
she was married and gone, he turned livid with
wrath and told them that that was impossible, as
he was the bridegroom.</p>

<p>By this time the guests had gathered in curious
groups in the hall and on the stairs, listening, and
when he claimed to be the bridegroom they shouted
with laughter, thinking this must be some practical
joke or else that the man was insane. But one older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
gentleman, a friend of the family, stepped up to the
excited visitor and said in a quieting voice:</p>

<p>“My friend, you have made a mistake! Miss
Hathaway has this evening been married to Mr.
George Hayne, just arrived from abroad, and they
are at this moment on their way to take the train.
You have come too late to see her, or else you have
the wrong address, and are speaking of some other
Miss Hathaway. That is very likely the explanation.”</p>

<p>George looked around on the company with
helpless rage, then rushed to his taxicab and gave
the order for the station.</p>

<p>Arriving at the station, he saw it was within half
a minute of the departure of the Chicago train, and
none knew better than he what time that train had
been going to depart. Had he not given minute
directions regarding the arrangements to his future
brother-in-law? What did it all mean anyway?
Had Celia managed somehow to carry out the wedding
without him to hide her mortification at his
non-appearance? Or had she run away? He was
too excited to use his reason. He could merely urge
his heavy bulk onward toward the fast fleeting train;
and dashed up the platform, overcoat streaming
from his arm, coat-tails flying, hat crushed down
upon his head, his fat, bechalked legs rumbling heavily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
after him. He passed Jefferson and his mother;
watching tearfully, lingeringly, the retreating train.
Jefferson laughed at the funny spectacle, but the
mother did not notice and only said absently: “I
think he’ll be good to her, don’t you, Jeff? He has
nice eyes. I don’t remember that his eyes used to
seem so pleasant, and so—deferential.” Then they
turned to go back to their car, and the train moved
faster and faster out of the station. It would presently
rush away out into the night, leaving the two
pursuers to face each other, baffled.</p>

<p>Both realized this at the same instant and the
short, thick-set man with sudden decision turned
again and plunging along with the train caught at
the rail and swung himself with dangerous precipitation
to the last platform of the last car with a
half-frightened triumph. Looking back he saw the
other man with a frantic effort sprint forward,
trying to do the same thing, and failing in the
attempt, sprawl flat on the platform, to the intense
amusement of a couple of trainmen standing near.</p>

<p>George Hayne, having thus come to a full stop
in his headlong career, lay prostrate for a moment,
stunned and shaken; then gathered himself up slowly
and stood gazing after the departing train. After
all, if he had caught it what could he have done? It
was incredible that Celia could have got herself married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and gone on her wedding trip without him. If
she had eloped with some one else and they were on
that train what could he have done? Kill the bridegroom
and force the bride to return with him and
be married over again? Yes, but that might have
been a trifle awkward after all, and he had enough
awkward situations to his account already. Besides,
it wasn’t in the least likely that Celia was married
yet. Those people at the house had been fooled
somehow, and she had run away. Perhaps her
mother and brother were gone with her. The same
threats that had made her bend to him once should
follow her wherever she had gone. She would
marry him yet and pay for this folly a hundred fold.
He lifted a shaking hand of execration toward the
train which by this time was vanishing into the dark
opening at the end of the station, where signal lights
like red berries festooned themselves in an arch
against the blackness, and the lights of the last car
paled and vanished like a forgotten dream.</p>

<p>Then he turned and hobbled slowly back to the
gates regardless of the merriment he was arousing
in the genial trainmen; for he was spent and bruised,
and his appearance was anything but dignified. No
member of the wedding company had they seen him
at this juncture would have recognized in him any
resemblance to the handsome gentleman who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
played his part in the wedding ceremony. No one
would have thought it possible that he could be
Celia Hathaway’s bridegroom.</p>

<p>Slowly back to the gate he crept, haggard, dishevelled,
crestfallen; his hair in its several isolated
locks downfallen over his forehead, his collar wilted,
his clothes smeared with chalk and dust, his overcoat
dragging forlornly behind him. He was trying
to decide what to do next, and realizing the torment
of a perpetual thirst, when a hand was laid suddenly
upon him and a voice that somehow had a familiar
twang, said: “You will come with me, sir.”</p>

<p>He looked up and there before him in the flesh
were the eyes of the man who had haunted him for
years, the very eyes grown younger, and filled with
more than reproach. They were piercing him with
the keenness of retribution. They said, as plainly as
those eyes in the closet had spoken but a brief hour
before: “Your time is over. My time has come.
You have sinned. You shall suffer. Come now
and meet your reward.”</p>

<p>He started back in horror. His hands trembled
and his brain reeled. He wished for another cocktail
to help him to meet this most extraordinary
emergency. Surely, something had happened to his
nerves that he was seeing these eyes in reality, and
hearing the voice, that old man’s voice made young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
bidding him come with him. It could not be, of
course. He was unnerved with all he had been
through. The man had mistaken him for some one—or
perhaps it was not a man after all. He glanced
quickly around to see if others saw him, and at once
became aware that a crowd was collecting about
them.</p>

<p>The man with the strange eyes and the familiar
voice was dressed in plain clothes, but he seemed to
have full assurance that he was a real live man and
had a right to dictate. George Hayne could not
shake away his grasp. There was a determination
about it that struck terror to his soul, and he had
a weak desire to scream and hide his eyes. Could
he be coming down with delirium tremens? That
brandy must have been unusually strong to have
lasted so long in its effects. Then he made a weak
effort to speak, but his voice sounded small and
frightened. The eyes took his assurance from him.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked, and meant to add,
“What right have <i>you</i> to dictate to <i>me</i>?” but the
words died away in his throat, for the plainclothes
man had opened his coat and disclosed a badge that
shone with a sinister light straight into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I am Norman Brand,” answered the voice,
“and I want you for what you did to my father.
It is time you paid your debt. You were the cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
of his humiliation and death. I have been watching
for you for years. I saw the notice of your wedding
in the paper and was tracking you. It was for this
I entered the service. Come with me.”</p>

<p>With a cry of horror George Hayne wrenched
away from his captor and turned to flee, but instantly
three revolvers were levelled at him, and
he found that two policemen in brass buttons were
stationed behind him, and the crowd closed in about
him. Wherever he turned it was to look into the
barrel of a gun, and there was no escape in any
direction.</p>

<p>They led him away to the patrol wagon, the erstwhile
bridegroom, and in place of the immaculate
linen he had searched so frantically for in his apartment
they put upon his wrists cuffs of iron. They
put him in a cell and left him with eyes of the old
man for company and the haunting likeness of his
son’s voice filling him with frenzy. The unquenchable
thirst came upon him and he begged for brandy
and soda, but none came to slake his thirst, for he
had crossed the great gulf and justice at last had him
in her grasp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> the man on the steps of the last car
of the Chicago Limited was having his doubts about
whether he ought to have boarded that train. He
realized that the fat traveller who was hurling himself
after the train had stirred in him a sudden
impulse which had been only half formed before
and he had obeyed it. Perhaps he was following a
wrong scent and would lose the reward which he
knew was his if he brought the thief of the code-writing,
dead or alive, to his employer. He was
half inclined to jump off again now before it was
too late; but looking down he saw they were already
speeding over a network of tracks, and trains were
flying by in every direction. By the time they were
out of this the speed would be too great for him to
attempt a jump. It was even now risky, and he
was heavy for athletics. He must do it at once if
he did it at all.</p>

<p>He looked ahead tentatively to see if the track
on which he must jump was clear, and the great eye
of an engine stabbed him in the face, as it bore
down upon him. The next instant it swept by, its
hot breath fanning his cheek, and he drew back
shuddering involuntarily. It was of no use. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
could not jump here. Perhaps they would slow up
or stop, and anyway, should he jump or stay on
board?</p>

<p>He sat down on the upper step the better to get
the situation in hand. Perhaps in a minute more
the way would be clearer to jump off if he decided
not to go on. Thus he vacillated. It was rather
unlike him not to know his own mind.</p>

<p>It seemed as if there must be something here to
follow, and yet, perhaps he was mistaken. He had
been the first man of the company at the front door
after Mr. Holman turned the paper over, and
they all had noticed the absence of the red mark.
It had been simultaneous with the clicking of
the door-latch and he had covered the ground
from his seat to the door sooner than anyone
else. He could swear he had seen the man get into
the cab that stood almost in front of the house.
He had lost no time in getting into his own car
which was detailed for such an emergency, and in
signalling the officer on a motor-cycle who was also
ready for a quick call. The carriage had barely
turned the corner when they followed, there was
no other of the kind in sight either way but that,
and he had followed it closely. It must have been
the right carriage. And yet, when the man got
out at the church he was changed, much changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
in appearance, so that he had looked twice into the
empty carriage to make sure that the man for whom
he searched was not still in there hiding. Then he
had followed him into the church and seen him married;
stood close at hand when he put his bride into
a big car, and he had followed the car to the house
where the reception was held; even mingling with
the guests and watching until the bridal couple left
for the train. He had stood in the alley in the
shadow, the only one of the guests who had found
how the bride was really going away, and again he
had followed to the station.</p>

<p>He had walked close enough to the bridegroom
in the station to be almost sure that mustache and
those heavy eyebrows were false; and yet he could
not make it out. How could it be possible that a
man who was going to be married in a great church
full of fashionable people would so dare to flirt with
chance as to accept an invitation to a dinner where
he might not be able to get away for hours? What
would have happened if he had not got there in
time? Was it in the least possible that these two
men could be identical? Everything but the likeness
and the fact that he had followed the man so
closely pointed out the impossibility.</p>

<p>The thick-set man was accustomed to trust his
inner impressions thoroughly, and in this case his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
inner impression was that he must watch this peculiar
bridegroom and be sure he was not the right
man before he forever got away from him—and
yet—and yet, he might be missing the right man by
doing it. However, he had come so far, had risked
a good deal already in following and in throwing
himself on that fast moving train. He would stay
a little longer and find out for sure. He would try
and get a seat where he could watch him and in an
hour he ought to be able to tell if he were really
the man who had stolen the code-writing. If he
could avoid the conductor for a time he would
simply profess to have taken the wrong train by
mistake and maybe could get put off somewhere near
home, in case he discovered that he was barking
up the wrong tree. He would stick to the train for
a little yet, inasmuch as there seemed no safe way
of getting off at present.</p>

<p>Having decided so much, he gave one last glance
toward the twinkling lights of the city hurrying past,
and getting up sauntered into the train, keeping a
weather eye out for the conductor. He meant to
burn no bridges behind him. He was well provided
with money for any kind of a trip and mileage books
and passes. He knew where to send a telegram
that would bring him instant assistance in case of
need, and even now he knew the officer on the motor-cycle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
had reported to his employer that he had
boarded this train. There was really no immediate
need for him to worry. It was big game he was
after and one must take some risks in a case of that
sort. Thus he entered the sleeper to make good the
impression of his inner senses.</p>

<p>Gordon had never held anything so precious, so
sweet and beautiful and frail-looking, in his arms.
He had a feeling that he ought to lay her down, yet
there was a longing to draw her closer to himself
and shield her from everything that could trouble
her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But she was not his—only a precious trust to be
guarded and cared for as vigilantly as the message
he carried hidden about his neck; she belonged to
another, somewhere, and was a sacred trust until
circumstances made it possible for him to return
her to her rightful husband. Just what all this
might mean to himself, to the woman in his arms,
and to the man whom she was to have married,
Gordon had not as yet had time to think. It was
as if he had been watching a moving picture and
suddenly a lot of circumstances had fallen in a
heap and become all jumbled up together, the result
of his own rash but unsuspecting steps, the way
whole families have in moving pictures of falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
through a sky-scraper from floor to floor, carrying
furniture and inhabitants with them as they descend.</p>

<p>He had not as yet been able to disentangle himself
from the debris and find out what had been his
fault and what he ought to do about it.</p>

<p>He laid her gently on the couch of the drawing-room
and opened the little door of the private
dressing-room. There would be cold water in there.</p>

<p>He knew very little about caring for sick people—he
had always been well and strong himself—but
cold water was what they used for people who
had fainted, he was sure. He would not call in anyone
to help, unless it was absolutely necessary. He
pulled the door of the stateroom shut, and went after
the water. As he passed the mirror, he started at
the curious vision of himself. One false eyebrow
had come loose and was hanging over his eye, and
his goatee was crooked. Had it been so all the
time? He snatched the eyebrow off, and then the
other; but the mustache and goatee were more
tightly affixed, and it was very painful to remove
them. He glanced back, and the white, limp look
of the girl on the couch frightened him. What was
he about, to stop over his appearance when she might
be dying, and as for pain—he tore the false hair
roughly from him, and, stuffing it into his pocket,
filled a glass with water and went back to the couch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
His chin and upper lip smarted, but he did not notice
it, nor know that the mark of the plaster was all
about his face. He only knew that she lay there
apparently lifeless before him, and he must bring
the soul back into those dear eyes. It was strange,
wonderful, how his feeling had grown for the girl
whom he had never seen till three hours before.</p>

<p>He held the glass to her white lips and tried
to make her drink, then poured water on his handkerchief
and awkwardly bathed her forehead. Some
hairpins slipped loose and a great wealth of golden-brown
hair fell across his knees as he half knelt beside
her. One little hand drooped over the side of
the couch and touched his. He started! It seemed
so soft and cold and lifeless.</p>

<p>He blamed himself that he had no remedies in
his suit-case. Why had he never thought to carry
something,—a simple restorative? Other people
might need it though he did not. No man ought to
travel without something for the saving of life in
an emergency. He might have needed it himself
even, in case of a railroad accident or something.</p>

<p>He slipped his arm tenderly under her head and
tried to raise it so that she could drink, but the
white lips did not move nor attempt to swallow.</p>

<p>Then a panic seized him. Suppose she was
dying? Not until later, when he had quiet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
opportunity for thought, did it occur to him what a
terrible responsibility he had dared to take upon
himself in letting her people leave her with him;
what a fearful position he would have been in if she
had really died. At the moment his whole thought
was one of anguish at the idea of losing her; anxiety
to save her precious life; and not for himself.</p>

<p>Forgetting his own need of quiet and obscurity,
he laid her gently back upon the couch again, and
rushed from the stateroom out into the aisle of the
sleeper. The conductor was just making his rounds
and he hurried to him with a white face.</p>

<p>“Is there a doctor on board, or have you any
restoratives? There is a lady——” He hesitated
and the color rolled freshly into his anxious face.
“That is—my wife.” He spoke the word unwillingly,
having at the instant of speaking realized that
he must say this to protect her good name. It seemed
like uttering a falsehood, or stealing another man’s
property; and yet, technically, it was true, and for
her sake at least he must acknowledge it.</p>

<p>“My wife,” he began again more connectedly,
“is ill—unconscious.”</p>

<p>The conductor looked at him sharply. He had
sized them up as a wedding party when they came
down the platform toward the train. The young
man’s blush confirmed his supposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“I’ll see!” he said briefly. “Go back to her and
I’ll bring some one.”</p>

<p>It was just as Gordon turned back that the thick-set
man entered the car from the other end and met
him face to face, but Gordon was too distraught at
that moment to notice him, for his mind was at rest
about his pursuer as soon as the train started.</p>

<p>Not so with the pursuer however. His keen little
eyes took in the white, anxious face, the smear of
sticking plaster about the mouth and eyebrows,
and instantly knew his man. His instincts had not
failed him after all.</p>

<p>He put out a pair of brawny fists to catch at
him, but a lurch of the train and Gordon’s swift
stride out-purposed him, and by the time the little
man had righted his footing Gordon was disappearing
into the stateroom, and the conductor with another
man was in the aisle behind him waiting to
pass. He stepped back and watched. At least he
had driven his prey to quarry and there was no possible
escape now until the train stopped. He would
watch that door as a cat watches a mouse, and perhaps
be able to send a telegram for help before he
made any move at all. It was as well that his impulse
to take the man then and there had come to
naught. What would the other passengers have
thought of him? He must of course move cautiously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
What a blunder he had almost made. It
was no part of his purpose to make public his errand.
The men who were behind him did not wish to be
known, nor to have their business known.</p>

<p>With narrowing eyes he watched the door of the
stateroom as the conductor and doctor came and
went. He gathered from a few questions asked
by one of the passengers that there was some one
sick, probably the lady he had seen faint as the
train started. It occurred to him that this might
be his opportunity, and when the conductor came
out of the drawing-room the second time he inquired
if any assistance was needed, and implied that
doctoring was his profession, though it would be
a sorry patient that had only his attention. However,
if he had one accomplishment it was bluffing,
and he never stopped at any profession that suited
his needs.</p>

<p>The conductor was annoyed at the interruptions
that had already occurred and he answered him
brusquely that they had all the help necessary and
there wasn’t anything the matter anyway.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for the man to do but
wait.</p>

<p>He subsided with his eye on the stateroom door,
and later secured a berth in plain sight of that door,
but gave no order to have it made up until every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
other passenger in the car was gone to what rest
a sleeping-car provides. He kept his vigil well, but
was rewarded with no sight of his prey that night,
and at last with a sense of duty well done and the
comfortable promise from the conductor that his
deftly worded telegraphic message to Mr. Holman
should be sent from a station they passed a little
after midnight, he crept to his well-earned rest. He
was not at home in a dress shirt and collar, being
of the walks of life where a collar is mostly
accounted superfluous, and he was glad to be relieved
of it for a few hours. It had not yet occurred to
him that his appearance in that evening suit would
be a trifle out of place when morning came. It
is doubtful if he had ever considered matters of
dress. His profession was that of a human ferret
of the lower order, and there were many things he
did not know. It might have been the way he held
his fork at dinner that had made Gordon decide that
he was but a henchman of the others.</p>

<p>Having put his mind and his body at rest he proceeded
to sleep, and the train thundered on its way
into the night.</p>

<p>Gordon meanwhile had hurried back from his
appeal to the conductor, and stood looking helplessly
down at the delicate girl as she lay there so white
and seemingly lifeless. Her pretty travelling gown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
set off the exquisite face finely; her glorious hair
seemed to crown her. A handsome hat had fallen
unheeded to the floor, and lay rolling back and
forth in the aisle with the motion of the train. He
picked it up reverently, as though it had been a
part of her. His face in the few minutes had gone
haggard.</p>

<p>The conductor hurried in presently, followed by
a grave elderly man with a professional air. He
touched a practised finger to the limp wrist, looked
closely into the face, and then taking a little bottle
from a case he carried called for a glass.</p>

<p>The liquid was poured between the closed lips,
the white throat reluctantly swallowed it, the eyelids
presently fluttered, a long breath that was scarcely
more than a sigh hovered between the lips, and then
the blue eyes opened.</p>

<p>She looked about, bewildered, looking longest at
Gordon, then closed her eyes wearily, as if she
wished they had not brought her back, and lay still.</p>

<p>The physician still knelt beside her, and Gordon,
with time now to think, began to reflect on the
possible consequences of his deeds. With anxious
face, he stood watching, reflecting bitterly that he
might not claim even a look of recognition from
those sweet eyes, and wishing with all his heart that
his marriage had been genuine. A passing memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of his morning ride to New York in company with
Miss Bentley’s conjured vision brought wonder to
his eyes. It all seemed so long ago, and so strange
that he ever could have entertained for a moment
the thought of marrying Julia. She was a good girl
of course, fine and handsome and all that,—but—and
here his eyes sought the sweet sad face on the
couch, and his heart suffered in a real agony for
the trouble he saw; and for the trouble he must
yet give to her when he told her who he was, or
rather who he was not; for he must tell her and that
soon. It would not do to go on in her company—nor
to Chicago! And yet, how was he possibly to
leave her in this condition?</p>

<p>But no revelations were to be given that night.</p>

<p>The physician administered another draught, and
ordered the porter to make up the berth immediately.
Then with skilful hands and strong arms he laid the
young girl in upon the pillows and made her comfortable,
Gordon meanwhile standing awkwardly
by with averted eyes and troubled mien. He would
have liked to help, but he did not know how.</p>

<p>“She’d better not be disturbed any more than is
necessary to-night,” said the doctor, as he pulled
the pretty cloth travelling gown smoothly down
about the girl’s ankles and patted it with professional
hands. “Don’t let her yield to any nonsense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
about putting up her hair, or taking off that frock
for fear she’ll rumple it. She needs to lie perfectly
quiet. It’s a case of utter exhaustion, and I should
say a long strain of some kind—anxiety, worry perhaps.”
He looked keenly at the sheepish bridegroom.
“Has she had any trouble?”</p>

<p>Gordon lifted honest eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” he answered contritely, as if it
must have been his fault some way.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let her have any more,” said the
elder man briskly. “She’s a very fragile bit of
womanhood, young man, and you’ll have to handle
her carefully or she’ll blow away. Make her <i>happy</i>,
young man! People can’t have too much happiness
in this world. It’s the best thing, after all, to keep
them well. Don’t be afraid to give her plenty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Gordon, fervently, wishing
it were in his power to do what the physician
ordered.</p>

<p>The kindly physician, the assiduous porter, and
the brusque but good-hearted conductor went away
at last, and Gordon was left with his precious charge,
who to all appearances was sleeping quietly. The
light was turned low and the curtains of the berth
were a little apart. He could see the dim outline of
drapery about her, and one shadowy hand lying
limp at the edge of the couch, in weary relaxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Above her, in the upper berth, which he had told
the porter not to make up, lay the great purple-black
plumed hat, and a sheaf of lilies of the valley from
her bouquet. It seemed all so strange for him to
be there in their sacred presence.</p>

<p>He locked the door, so that no one should disturb
the sleeper, and went slowly into the little
private dressing-room. For a full minute after he
reached it, he stood looking into the mirror before
him, looking at his own weary, soiled face, and wondering
if he, Cyril Gordon, heretofore honored and
self-respecting, had really done in the last twelve
hours all the things which he was crediting himself
with having done! And the question was, how had
it happened? Had he taken leave of his senses, or
had circumstances been too much for him? Had he
lost the power of judging between right and wrong?
Could he have helped any of the things that had
come upon him? How could he have helped them?
What ought he to have done? What ought he to
do now? Was he a criminal beyond redemption?
Had he spoiled the life of the sweet woman out there
in her berth, or could he somehow make amends
for what he had done? And was he as badly to
blame for it all as he felt himself to be?</p>

<p>After a minute he rallied, to realize that his face
was dirty. He washed the marks of the adhesive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
plaster away, and then, not satisfied with the result,
he brought his shaving things from his suit-case and
shaved. Somehow, he felt more like himself after
his toilet was completed, and he slipped back into
the darkened drawing-room and stretched himself
wearily on the couch, which, according to his directions,
was not made up, but merely furnished with
pillows and a blanket.</p>

<p>The night settled into the noisy quiet of an express
train, and each revolution of the wheels, as
they whirled their way Chicagoward, resolved itself
into the old refrain, “Don’t let anything hinder
you! Don’t let anything hinder you!”</p>

<p>He certainly was not taking the most direct
route from New York to Washington, though it
might eventually prove that the longest way round
was the shortest way home, on account of its comparative
safety.</p>

<p>As he settled to the quiet of his couch, a number
of things came more clearly to his vision. One
was that they had safely passed the outskirts of
New York without interference of any kind, and
must by this time be speeding toward Albany, unless
they were on a road that took them more directly
West. He had not thought to look at the tickets
for knowledge of his bearings, and the light was
too dim for him to make out any monograms or letterings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
on inlaid wood panels or transoms, even if
he had known enough about New York railroads
to gain information from them. There was one
thing certain: even if he had been mistaken about
his supposed pursuers, by morning there would
surely be some one searching for him. The duped
Holman combination would stop at nothing when
they discovered his theft of the paper, and he could
not hope that so sharp-eyed a man as Mr. Holman
had seemed to be would be long in discovering the
absence of his private mark on the paper. Undoubtedly
he knew it already. As for the frantic bridegroom,
Gordon dreaded the thought of meeting him.
It must be put off at any hazards until the message
was safe with his chief, then, if he had to answer
with his life for carrying off another man’s bride, he
could at least feel that he left no duty to his government
undone. It was plain that his present situation
was a dangerous one from two points of view,
for the bridegroom would have no difficulty in
finding out what train he and the lady had taken;
and he was satisfied that an emissary of Holman had
more than a suspicion of his identity. The obvious
thing to do was to get off that train at the first opportunity
and get across country to another line of railroad.
But how was that to be done with a sick
lady on his hands? Of course he could leave her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
to herself. She probably had taken journeys before,
and would know how to get back. She would
at least be able to telegraph to her friends to come
for her. He could leave her money and a note explaining
his involuntary villainy, and her indignation
with him would probably be a sufficient stimulant
to keep her from dying of chagrin at her plight.
But as from the first every nerve and fibre in him
rejected this suggestion. It would be cowardly,
unmanly, horrible! Undoubtedly it might be the
wise thing to do from many standpoints, but—<i>never</i>!
He could no more leave her that way than he could
run off to save his life and leave that message he
carried. She was a trust as much as that. He had
got into this, and he must get out somehow, but he
would not desert the lady or neglect his duty.</p>

<p>Toward morning, when his fitful vigil became
less lucid it occurred to him that he ought really
to have deserted the bride while she was still unconscious,
jumping off the train at the short stop
they made soon after she fell into his arms. She
would then have been cared for by some one, his
absence discovered, and she would have been put off
the train and her friends sent for at once. But it
would have been dastardly to have deserted her that
way not knowing even if she still lived, he on whom
she had at least a claim of temporary protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>It was all a terrible muddle, right and wrong
juggled in such a mysterious and unusual way. He
never remembered to have come to a spot before
where it was difficult to know which of two things
it was right to do. There had always before been
such clearly defined divisions. He had supposed
that people who professed not to know what was
right were people who wished to be blinded on the
subject because they wished to do wrong and think
it right. But now he saw that he had judged such
too harshly.</p>

<p>Perhaps his brain had been overstrained with
the excitement and annoyances of the day, and
he was not quite in a condition to judge what was
right. He ought to snatch a few minutes’ sleep, and
then his mind would be clearer, for something must
be done and that soon. It would not do to risk
entering a large city where detectives and officers
with full particulars might even now be on the watch
for him. He was too familiar with the workings of
retribution in this progressive age not to know his
danger. But he really must get some sleep.</p>

<p>At last he yielded to the drowsiness that was
stealing over him—just for a moment, he thought,
and the wheels hummed on their monotonous song:
“Don’t let anything hinder! Don’t let anything——!
Don’t let——! Don’t! Hin-der-r-r-r!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man slept, and the train rushed on. The
night waned. The dawn grew purple in the east,
and streaked itself with gold; then later got out a
fillet of crimson and drew over its cloudy forehead.
The breath of the lilies filled the little room with delicate
fragrance, and mingled strange scenes in the
dreams of the man and the woman so strangely
united.</p>

<p>The sad little bride grew restless and stirred, but
the man on the couch did not hear her. He was
dreaming of a shooting affray, in which he carried
a bride in a gold pencil and was shot for stealing a
sandwich out of Mr. Holman’s vest-pocket.</p>

<p>The morning light grew clearer. The east had
put on a vesture of gold above her purple robe, and
its reflection shone softly in at the window, for
the train was just at that moment rushing northward,
though its general course was west.</p>

<p>The sleeper behind the thick green curtains
stirred again and became conscious, as in many days
past, of her heavy burden of sorrow. Always at
first waking the realization of it sat upon her as
though it would crush the life from her body. Lying
still with bated breath, she fought back waking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
consciousness as she had learned to do in the last
three months, yet knew it to be futile while she was
doing it.</p>

<p>The sun shot up between the bars of crimson,
like a topaz on a lady’s gown that crowns the whole
beautiful costume. The piercing, jewelled light lay
across the white face, touched the lips with warm
fingers, and the troubled soul knew all that had
passed.</p>

<p>She lay quiet, letting the torrent sweep over her
with its sickening realization. She was married!
It was over—with the painful parting from dear
ones. She was off away from them all. The new
life she so dreaded had begun, and how was she to
face it—the life with one whom she feared and
did not respect? How could she ever have done it
but for the love of her dear ones?</p>

<p>Gradually she came to remember the night before—the
parting with her mother and her brother;
the little things that brought the tears again to her
eyes. Then all was blankness. She must have
fainted. She did not often faint, but it must be—yes,
she remembered opening her eyes and seeing
men’s faces about her, and George—could it have
been George?—with a kinder look in his eyes than
she had ever thought to see there. Then she must
have fainted again—or had she? No, some one had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
lifted her into this berth, and she had drunk something
and had gone to sleep. What had happened?
Where was everybody? It was good to have been
left alone. She grudgingly gave her unloved husband
a fragment of gratitude for not having tried
to talk to her. In the carriage on the way he had
seemed determined to begin a long argument of some
kind. She did not want to argue any more. She
had written tomes upon the subject, and had said
all she had to say. He was not deceived. He knew
she did not love him, and would never have married
him but for her mother’s sake and for the sake of
her beloved father’s memory. What was the use
of saying more? Let it rest. The deed was done,
and they were married. Now let him have his way
and make her suffer as he chose. If he would but
let her suffer in silence and not inflict his bitter
tongue upon her, she would try to bear it. And perhaps—oh,
perhaps, she would not live long, and it
would soon be all over.</p>

<p>As the daylight grew, the girl felt an inclination
to find out whether her husband was near. Cautiously
she lifted her head, and, drawing back a corner
of the curtain, peered out.</p>

<p>He lay quietly on the couch, one hand under his
cheek against the pillow, the other across his breast,
as if to guard something. He was in the still sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of the overwearied. He scarcely seemed to be
breathing.</p>

<p>Celia dropped the curtain, and put her hand to
her throat. It startled her to find him so near and
so still. Softly, stealthily, she lay down again and
closed her eyes. She must not waken him. She
would have as long a time to herself as was possible,
and try to think of her dear mother and her
precious brother. Oh, if she were just going away
from them alone, how well she could bear it! But
to be going with one whom she had always almost
hated——</p>

<p>Her brother’s happy words about George suddenly
came to her mind. Jefferson had thought
him fine. Well, of course the dear boy knew nothing
about it. He had not read all those letters—those
awful letters. He did not know the threats—the
terrible language that had been used. She shuddered
as she thought of it. But in the same breath
she was glad that her brother had been deceived.
She would not have it otherwise. Her dear ones
must never know what she had gone through to save
them from disgrace and loss of fortune—disgrace,
of course, being the first and greatest. She had
feared that George would let them see through his
veneer of manners, and leave them troubled, but he
had made a better appearance than she had hoped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Ten years had made a greater change in him than
she had expected. He really had not been so bad as
her conjured image of him.</p>

<p>Then a sudden desire to look at him again seized
her, to know once for all just how he really did seem.
She would not want to notice him awake any more
than she could help, nor dare, lest he presume upon
her sudden interest, to act as if he had never
offended; but if she should look at him now as he
lay asleep she might study his face and see what
she really had to expect.</p>

<p>She fought the desire to peer at him again, but
finally it gained complete possession of her, and she
drew back the curtain once more.</p>

<p>He was lying just as quietly as before. His
heavy hair, a little disordered on the pillow, gave
him a noble, interesting appearance. He did not
seem at all a fellow of whom to be afraid. It was
incredible that he could have written those letters.</p>

<p>She tried to trace in his features a likeness to
the youth of ten years ago, whom she had known
when she was but a little girl, who had tied her
braids to her chair, and put raw oysters and caterpillars
down her back, or stretched invisible cords
to trip her feet in dark places; who made her visits
to a beloved uncle—whom he also had the right to
call uncle, though he was no cousin of hers—a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
list of catastrophes resulting in tears; who had never
failed to mortify her on all occasions possible, and
once—— But the memories were too horrible as
they crowded one upon another! Let them be forgotten!</p>

<p>She watched the face before her keenly, critically,
yet she could see no trace of any such character
as she had imagined the boy George must have
developed as a man; of which his letters had given
her ample proof. This man’s face was finely-cut
and sensitive. There was nothing coarse or selfish
in its lines. The long, dark eyelashes lay above
dark circles of weariness, and gave that look of
boyishness that always touches the maternal
chord in a woman’s heart. George used to have a
puffy, self-indulgent look under his eyes even when
he was a boy. She had imagined from his last
photograph that he would be much stouter, much
more bombastic; but, then, in his sleep, perhaps
those things fell from a man.</p>

<p>She tried to turn away indifferently, but something
in his face held her. She studied it. If he had
been any other man, any stranger, she would have
said from looking at him critically that kindness
and generosity, self-respect and respect for women,
were written all over the face before her. There
was fine, firm modelling about the lips and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
clean-shaven chin; and about the forehead the look
almost of a scholar; yet she thought she knew the
man before her to be none of these things. How deceptive
were looks! She would probably be envied
rather than pitied by all who saw her. Well, perhaps
that was better. She could the easier keep her
trouble to herself. But stay, what was there about
this man that seemed different? The smooth face?
Yes. She had the dim impression that last night
he wore a mustache. She must have been mistaken,
of course. She had only looked at him when absolutely
necessary, and her brain was in such a whirl;
but still there seemed to be something different
about him.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered to the hand that lay across
his breast. It was the fine white hand of the professional
man, the kind of hand that somehow
attracts the eye with a sense of cleanness and
strength. There was nothing flabby about it.
George as a boy used to have big, stumpy fingers and
nails chewed down to the quick. She could remember
how she used to hate to look at them when she
was a little girl, and yet somehow could not keep
her eyes away. She saw with relief that the nails
on this hand were well shaped and well cared for.</p>

<p>He looked very handsome and attractive as he
lay there. The sun shot one of its early daring bolts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of light across his hair as the train turned in its
course and lurched northward around a curve. It
glinted there for a moment, like a miniature search-light,
travelling over the head, showing up every
wave and curve. He had the kind of hair which
makes a woman’s hand instinctively long to touch it.
Celia wondered at the curious thoughts that
crowded through her mind, knowing that all the
while there was the consciousness that when this
man should wake she would think of nothing but his
hateful personality as she had known it through the
years. And she was his wife! How strange! How
terrible! How impossible to live with the thought
through interminable weary years! Oh, that she
might die at once before her strength failed and her
mother found out her sorrow!
She lay back again on her pillows very still and
tried to think, but somehow a pleasant image of
him, her husband, lingered in her memory. Could
it be possible that she would ever see anything pleasant
in him? Ever endure the days of his companionship?
Ever come to the point where she could
overlook his outrageous conduct toward her, forgive
him, and be even tolerant of him? Sharp memories
crowded upon her, and the smarting tears stung their
way into her eyes, answering and echoing in her
heart, “No, no, a thousand times, no!” She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
paid his price and gained redemption for her own,
but—forget what he had done? <i>Never!</i></p>

<p>The long strain of weariness, and the monotony
of the onrushing train, lulled her half into unconsciousness
again, and the man on the couch slumbered
on.</p>

<p>He came to himself suddenly, with all his senses
on the alert, as the thumping noise and motion of
the train ceased, and a sudden silence of open country
succeeded, broken now and again by distant
oncoming and receding voices. He caught the fragment
of a sentence from some train official: “It’s
a half-hour late, and maybe more. We’ll just have
to lie by, that’s all. Here, you, Jim, take this flag
and run up to the switch——” The voice trailed
into the distance, ended by the metallic note of a
hammer doing something mysterious to the underpinning
of the car.</p>

<p>Gordon sat up suddenly, his hand yet across his
breast, where his first waking thought had been to
feel if the little pencil-case were safe.</p>

<p>Glancing stealthily toward the curtains of the
berth, and perceiving no motion, he concluded that
the girl still slept.</p>

<p>Softly he slipped his feet into his shoes, gave
one or two other touches to his toilet, and stood up,
looking toward the curtains. He wanted to go out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and see where they were stopping, but dared he go
without knowing that she was all right?</p>

<p>Softly, reverently, he stooped and brought his
face close to the opening in the curtains. Celia felt
his eyes upon her. Her own were closed, and by a
superhuman effort she controlled her breathing,
slowly, gently, as if she were asleep.</p>

<p>He looked for a long moment, thrilled by the
delicate beauty of her sleeping face, filled with an
intoxicating joy to see that her lips were no longer
white; then, turning reverently away, he unlocked
the door and stepped forth.</p>

<p>The other occupants of the car were still wrapped
in slumber. Loud snores of various kinds and
qualities testified to that. A dim light at the further
end contended luridly, and losingly, with the daylight
now flooding the outside world and creeping
mischievously into the transoms.</p>

<p>Gordon closed the door of the compartment
noiselessly and went down the aisle to the end of
the car.</p>

<p>A door was open, and he could hear voices outside.
The conductor stood talking with two brakemen.
He heard the words: “Three-quarters of an
hour at least,” and then the men walked off toward
the engine.</p>

<p>Gordon looked across the country, and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
first time since he started on his journey let himself
remember that it was springtime and May.</p>

<p>There had been a bitter wind the night before,
with a hint of rain in the air. In fact, it had rained
quite smartly during the ride to the hospital with
the hurt child, but he had been so perturbed that
he had taken little notice of the weather. But this
was a radiant morning.</p>

<p>The sun was in one of its most charming moods,
when it touches everything with a sort of unnatural
glory after the long winter of darkness and cold.
Every tree trunk in the distance seemed to stand out
clearly, every little grass-blade was set with a glowing
jewel, and the winding stream across a narrow
valley fairly blazed with brightness. The very road
with its deep, clean wheel-grooves seemed like a
well-taken photograph.</p>

<p>The air had an alluring softness mingled with
its tang of winter that made one long to take a walk
anywhere out into the world, just for the joy of
being and doing. A meadow-lark shot up from
somewhere to a telegraph pole, let go a blithe note,
and hurried on. It was glorious. The exhilaration
filled Gordon’s blood.</p>

<p>And here was the chance he craved to slip away
from the train before it reached a place where he
could be discovered. If he had but thought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
bring his suit-case! He could slip back now without
being noticed and get it! He could even go without
it! But—he could not leave her that way—could
he? Ought he? Perhaps he ought—— But it
would not do to leave his suit-case with her, for
it contained letters addressed to his real name. An
explanation would of course be demanded, and he
could never satisfy a loving mother and brother for
having left a helpless girl in such a situation—even
if he could satisfy his own conscience, which he
knew he never could. He simply could not leave
her, and yet he <i>must</i> get away from that train as
soon as possible. Perhaps this was the only opportunity
he would have before reaching Buffalo, and
it was very risky, indeed dangerous, to dare enter
Buffalo. It was a foregone conclusion that there
would be private detectives ready to meet the train
in Buffalo with full descriptions and particulars and
only too ready to make way with him if they could
do so without being found out. He looked nervously
back at the door of the car. Dared he attempt
to waken her and say that they had made a mistake
and must change cars? Was she well enough?
And where could they go?</p>

<p>He looked off toward the landscape for answer
to his question.</p>

<p>They were decidedly in the country. The train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
stood at the top of a high embankment of cinders,
below which was a smooth country road running
parallel to the railroad for some distance till it met
another road at right angles to it, which stretched
away between thrifty meadow-lands to a nestling
village. The glorified stream he had first noticed
far up the valley glinted narrower here in the morning
light, with a suggestion of watercress and forget-me-nots
in its fringes as it veered away under
a bridge toward the village and hid itself in a tangle
of willows and cat-tails.</p>

<p>How easy it would be to slide down that embankment,
and walk out that road over the bridge to the
village, where of course a conveyance of some sort
could be hired to bear him to another railroad town
and thence to—Pittsburgh, perhaps, where he could
easily get a train to Washington. How easy if only
he were not held by some invisible hands to care for
the sweet sleeper inside the car! And yet, for her
sake as well as his own, he must do something, and
that right speedily.</p>

<p>He was standing thus in deep meditation, looking
off at the little village which seemed so near and
yet would be so far for her to walk, when he was
pervaded with that strange sense of some one near.
For an instant he resisted the desire to lift his eyes
and prove to himself that no one was present in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
doorway which a moment before he knew had been
unoccupied. Then, frowning at his own nervousness,
he turned.</p>

<p>She stood there in all the beauty of her fresh
young girlhood, a delicate pallor on her cheeks, and
a deep sadness in her great dark eyes, which were
fixed upon him intently, in a sort of puzzled study.
She was fully dressed, even to her hat and gloves.
Every wave of her golden hair lay exquisitely in
place under the purple hat, as though she might
have taken an hour or two at her toilet; yet she had
made it with excited haste, and with trembling fingers,
determined to have it accomplished before the
return of her dreaded liege lord.</p>

<p>She had sprung from her berth the instant he
closed the door upon her, and fastened the little
catch to bar him out. She had dashed cold water
into her face, fastened her garments hurriedly, and
tossed the glory of her hair into place with a few
touches and what hairpins she could find on the
floor. Then putting on her hat, coat, and gloves,
she had followed him into the outer air. She had
a feeling that she must have air to breathe or she
would suffocate. A wild desire filled her to go alone
into the great out-of-doors. Oh, if she but dared to
run away from him! But that she might not do, for
all his threats would then probably be made good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
by him upon her dear mother and brother. No, she
must be patient and bear to the end all that was set
down for her. But she would get out and breathe
a little before he returned. He had very likely gone
into the smoker. She remembered that the George
of old had been an inveterate smoker of cigarettes.
She would have time for a taste of the morning
while he had his smoke. And if he returned and
found her gone what mattered it? The inevitable
beginning of conversations which she so dreaded
would be put off for a time.</p>

<p>She never thought to come upon him standing
thus alone, looking off at the beauty of the morning
as if he enjoyed it. The sight of him held her still,
watching, as his sleeping face had held her gaze
earlier in the morning. How different he was from
what she had expected! How the ten years had
changed him! One could almost fancy it might
have changed his spirit also—but for those letters—those
terrible letters! The writer of those letters
could not change, except for the worse!
And yet, he was handsome, intellectual looking,
kindly in his bearing, appreciative of the beauty
about him—she could not deny it. It was most
astonishing. He had lost that baggy look under
his eyes, and the weak, selfish, cruel pout of lip
she remembered so keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Then he turned, and a smile of delight and welcome
lit up his face. In spite of herself, she could
not keep an answering smile from glimmering
faintly in her own.</p>

<p>“What! You up and out here?” he said, hastening
closer to the step. “How are you feeling
this morning? Better, I’m sure, or you would not
be here so early.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had to get out to the air,” she said.
“I couldn’t stand the car another minute. I wish
we could walk the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” he said, with a quick, surprised
appreciation in his voice. “I was just wishing something
like that myself. Do you see that beautiful
straight road down there? I was longing to slide
down this bank and walk over to that little village
for breakfast. Then we could get an auto, perhaps,
or a carriage, to take us on to another train. If
you hadn’t been so ill last night, I might have proposed
it.”</p>

<p>“Could we?” she asked, earnestly. “I should
like it so much;” and there was eagerness in her
voice. “What a lovely morning!” Her eyes were
wistful, like the eyes of those who weep and wonder
why they may not laugh, since sunshine is still
yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Of course we could,” he said, “if you were
only able.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m able enough. I should much rather
do that than to go back into that stuffy car. But
wouldn’t they think it awfully queer of us to run
away from the train this way?”</p>

<p>“They needn’t know anything about it,” he
declared, like a boy about to play truant. “I’ll slip
back in the car and get our suit-cases. Is there anything
of yours I might be in danger of leaving
behind?”</p>

<p>“No, I put everything in my suit-case before I
came out,” she said, listlessly, as though she had
already lost her desire to go.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you are not able,” he said, pausing
solicitously as he scaled the steps.</p>

<p>She was surprised at his interest in her welfare.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I am,” she said, insistently.
“I have often taken longer walks than that looks to
be, and I shall feel much better for being out. I
really feel as if I couldn’t stand it any longer in
there.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then, we’ll try it!”</p>

<p>He hurried in for the baggage and left her
standing on the cinder roadbed beside the train looking
off at the opening morning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was just at that instant that the thick-set man
in his berth not ten feet away became broadly conscious
of the unwonted stillness of the train and the
cessation of motion that had lulled him to such
sound repose. So does a tiny, sharp sound strike
upon our senses and bring them into life again
from sleep, making us aware of a state of things
that has been going on for some time perhaps without
our realization. The sound that roused him
may have been the click of the stateroom latch as
Gordon opened the door.</p>

<p>The shades were down in the man’s berth and
the curtains drawn close. The daylight had not
as yet penetrated through their thickness. But once
awake his senses were immediately on the alert. He
yawned, stretched and suddenly arrested another
yawn to analyze the utter stillness all about him. A
sonorous snore suddenly emphasized the quiet of
the car, and made him aware of all the occupants of
all those curtained apartments. His mind went
over a quick résumé of the night before, and detailed
him at once to duty.</p>

<p>Another soft clicking of the latch set him to
listening and his bristly shocked head was stuck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
instantly out between the curtains into the aisle,
eyes toward the stateroom door, just in time to see
that a man was stealing quietly down the passageway
out of the end door, carrying two suit-cases and
an umbrella. It was his man. He was sure instantly,
and his mind grew frantic with the thought.
Almost he had outdone himself through foolish
sleep.</p>

<p>He half sprang from his berth, then remembered
that he was but partly dressed, and jerked back
quickly to grab his clothes, stopping in the operation
of putting them on to yank up his window shade
with an impatient click and flatten his face against
the window-pane!</p>

<p>Yes, there they were down on the ground outside
the train, both of them; man, woman, baggage
and all slipping away from him while he slept peacefully
and let them go! The language of his mind
at that point was hot with invectives.</p>

<p>Gordon had made his way back to the girl’s side
without meeting any porters or wakeful fellow-passengers.
But a distant rumbling greeted his
ears. The waited-for express was coming. If they
were to get away, it must be done at once or their
flight would be discovered, and perhaps even prevented.
It certainly was better not to have it known
where they got off. He had taken the precaution to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
close the stateroom door behind him and so it might
be some time before their absence would be discovered.
Perhaps there would be other stops before
the train reached Buffalo, in which case their track
would not easily be followed. He had no idea that
the evil eye of his pursuer was even then upon him.</p>

<p>Celia was already on the ground, looking off
toward the little village wistfully. Just how it was
to make her lot any brighter to get out of the train
and run away to a strange little village she did not
quite explain to herself, but it seemed to be a relief
to her pent-up feelings. She was half afraid that
George might raise some new objection when he
returned.</p>

<p>Gordon swung himself down on the cinder path,
scanning the track either way. The conductor and
brakemen were not in sight. Far in the distance
a black speck was rushing down upon them. Gordon
could hear the vibration of the rail of the second
track, upon which he placed his foot as he helped
Celia across. In a moment more the train would
pass. It was important that they should be down
the embankment, out of sight. Would the delicate
girl not be afraid of the steep incline?</p>

<p>She hesitated for just an instant at the top, for
it was very steep. Then, looking up at him, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
saw that he expected her to go down with him. She
gave a little frightened gasp, set her lips, and started.</p>

<p>He held her as well as he could with two suit-cases
and an umbrella clutched in his other hand,
and finally, as the grade grew steeper, he let go the
baggage altogether, and it slid briskly down by itself,
while he devoted himself to steadying the girl’s now
inevitable and swift descent.</p>

<p>It certainly was not an ideal way of travelling,
this new style of “gravity” road, but it landed them
without delay, though much shaken and scratched,
and divested of every vestige of dignity. It was
impossible not to laugh, and Celia’s voice rang out
merrily, showing that she had not always wept and
looked sorrowful.</p>

<p>“Are you much hurt?” asked Gordon anxiously,
holding her hands and looking down at her tenderly.</p>

<p>Before she could reply, the express train roared
above them, drowning their voices and laughter;
and when it was past they saw their own train take
up its interrupted way grumblingly, and rapidly
move off. If the passengers on those two trains
had not been deeply wrapped in slumber, they might
have been surprised to see two fashionably attired
young persons, with hats awry and clasped hands,
laughing in a country road at five o’clock of a May
morning. But only one was awake, and by the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the two in the road below remembered to look up
and take notice, the trains were rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>The girl had been deeply impressed with Gordon’s
solicitude for her. It was so out of keeping
with his letters. He had never seemed to care
whether she suffered or not. In all the arrangements,
he had said what <i>he</i> wanted, indeed what he
<i>would have</i>, with an implied threat in the framing
of his sentence in case she dared demur. Never had
there been the least expression of desire for her
happiness. Therefore it was something of a surprise
to find him so gentle and thoughtful of her. Perhaps,
after all, he would not prove so terrible to
live with as she had feared. And yet—how could
anyone who wrote those letters have any alleviating
qualities? It could not be. She must harden herself
against him. Still, if he would be outwardly
decent to her, it would make her lot easier, of course.</p>

<p>But her course of mental reasoning was broken
in upon by his stout denunciations of himself.</p>

<p>“I ought not to have allowed you to slide down
there,” he declared. “It was terrible, after what
you went through last night. I didn’t realize how
steep and rough it was. Indeed I didn’t. I don’t
see how you ever can forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m not hurt,” she said gently, astonished
at his solicitation. There was a strange lump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
in her throat brought by his kindness, which threatened
tears. Just why should kindness from an unexpected
quarter bring tears?</p>

<p>“I’m only a little shaken up,” she went on as she
saw a real anxiety in his brown eyes, “and I don’t
mind it in the least. I think it was rather fun, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>A faint glimmer of a smile wavered over the corners
of her mouth, and Gordon experienced a sudden
desire to take her in his arms and kiss her. It was a
strange new feeling. He had never had any such
thought about Julia Bentley.</p>

<p>“Why, I—why, yes, I guess so, if you’re sure
you’re not hurt.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” she said, and then, for some unexplained
reason, they both began to laugh. After that
they felt better.</p>

<p>“If your shoes are as full of these miserable cinders
as mine are, they need emptying,” declared
Gordon, shaking first one well-shod foot and then
the other, and looking ruefully at the little velvet
boots of the lady.</p>

<p>“Suppose you sit down”—he looked about for a
seat, but the dewy grass was the only resting place
visible. He pitched upon the suit-cases and improvised
a chair. “Now, sit down and let me take them
off for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>He knelt in the road at her feet as she obeyed,
protesting that she could do it for herself. But he
overruled her, and began clumsily to unbutton the
tiny buttons, holding the timid little foot firmly,
almost reverently, against his knee.</p>

<p>He drew the velvet shoe softly off, and, turning
it upside down, shook out the intruding cinders, put
a clumsy finger in to make sure they were all gone;
then shyly, tenderly, passed his hand over the sole
of the fine silk-stockinged foot that rested so lightly
on his knee, to make sure no cinders clung to it. The
sight and touch of that little foot stirred him deeply.
He had never before been called upon to render service
so intimate to any woman, and he did it now
with half-averted gaze and the utmost respect in his
manner. As he did it he tried to speak about the
morning, the departing train, the annoying cinders,
anything to make their unusual position seem natural
and unstrained. He felt deeply embarrassed,
the more so because of his own double part in this
queer masquerade.</p>

<p>Celia sat watching him, strangely stirred. Her
wonder over his kindness grew with each moment,
and her prejudices almost dissolved. She could not
understand it. There must be something more he
wanted of her, for George Hayne had never been
kind in the past unless he wanted something of her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
She dreaded lest she should soon find it out. Yet
he did not look like a man who was deceiving her.
She drew a deep sigh. If only it were true, and he
were good and kind, and had never written those
awful letters! How good and dear it would be
to be tenderly cared for this way! Her lips drooped
at the corners, and her eyelids drooped in company
with the sigh; then Gordon looked up in great
distress.</p>

<p>“You are tired!” he declared, pausing in his
attempt to fasten the little pearl buttons. “I have
been cruel to let you get off the train!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I’m not,” said the girl, brightening with
sudden effort. At least, she would not spoil the
kindness while it lasted. It was surely better than
what she had feared.</p>

<p>“You never can button those shoes with your
fingers,” she laughed, as he redoubled his efforts
to capture a tiny disc of pearl and set it into its small
velvet socket. “Here! I have a button-hook in
my hand-bag. Try this.”</p>

<p>She produced a small silver instrument from a
gold-link bag on her arm and handed it to him. He
took it helplessly, trying first one end and then the
other, and succeeding with neither.</p>

<p>“Here, let me show you,” she laughed, pulling
off one glove. Her white fingers grasped the silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
button-hook, and flashed in and out of the velvet
holes, knitting the little shoe to the foot in no time.
He watched the process in humble wonder, and she
would not have been a human girl not to have
been flattered with his interest and admiration. For
the minute she forgot who and what he was, and let
her laugh ring out merrily; and so with shy audacity
he assayed to take off the other shoe.</p>

<p>They really felt quite well acquainted and as if
they were going on a day’s picnic, when they finally
gathered up their belongings and started down the
road. Gordon summoned all his ready wit and intellect
to brighten the walk for her, though he found
himself again and again on the brink of referring
to his Washington life, or some other personal
matter that would have brought a wondering question
to her lips. He had decided that he must not
tell her who he was until he could put her in an independent
position, where she could get away from him
at once if she chose. He was bound to look after
her until he could place her in good hands, or at least
where she could look after herself, and it was better
to carry it out leaving her to think what she pleased
until he could tell her everything. If all went well,
they might be able to catch a Pittsburgh train that
night and be in Washington the next day. Then, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
message delivered, he would tell her the whole story.
Until then he must hold his peace.</p>

<p>They went gaily down the road, the girl’s pale
cheeks beginning to flush with the morning and
the exercise. She was not naturally delicate, and
her faint the night before had been the result of a
series of heavy strains on a heart burdened with terrible
fear. The morning and his kindness had made
her forget for the time that she was supposed to be
walking into a world of dread and sacrifice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The year’s at the spring,</div>
<div class="verse">The day’s at the morn,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Gordon gaily,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Morning’s at seven;</div>
<div class="verse">The hill-side’s dew-pearled——”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He waved an umbrella off to where a hill flashed
back a thousand lights from its jewelled grass-blades
thickly set.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The lark’s on the wing;</div>
<div class="verse">The snail’s on the thorn,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>went on Celia suddenly catching his spirit, and pointing
to a lark that darted up into the blue with a
trill of the morning in his throat.</p>

<p>Gordon turned appreciative eyes upon her. It
was good to have her take up his favorite poet in that
tone of voice—a tone that showed she too knew and
loved Browning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“God’s in his heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">All’s right with the world,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>finished Gordon in a quieter voice, looking straight
into her eyes. “That seems very true, to-day,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The blue eyes wavered with a hint of shadow
in them as they looked back into the brown ones.</p>

<p>“Almost—perhaps,” she faltered wistfully.</p>

<p>The young man wished he dared go behind that
“almost—perhaps” and find out what she meant,
but concluded it were better to bring back the smile
and help her to forget for a little while at least.</p>

<p>Down by the brook, they paused to rest, under a
weeping willow, whose green-tinged plumes were
dabbling in the brook. Gordon arranged the suit-cases
for her to sit upon, then climbed down to the
brookside and gathered a great bunch of forget-me-nots,
blue as her eyes, and brought them to her.</p>

<p>She looked at them in wonder, to think they grew
out here, wild, untended. She had never seen them
before, except in pots in the florist’s windows. She
touched them delicately with the tips of her fingers,
as if they were too ethereal for earth; then fastened
them in the breast of her gown.</p>

<p>“They exactly match your eyes!” he exclaimed
involuntarily, and then wished he had not spoken,
for she flushed and paled under his glance, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
he felt he had been unduly bold. He wondered why
he had said that. He never had been in the habit
of saying pretty things to girls, but this girl somehow
called it from him. It was genuine. He sat a
moment abashed, not knowing what to say next, as
if he were a shy boy, and she did not help him, for
her eyelashes drooped in a long becoming sweep over
her cheeks, and she seemed for the moment not to
be able to carry off the situation. He was not sure if
she were displeased or not.</p>

<p>Her heart had thrilled strangely as he spoke, and
she was vexed with herself that it should be so. A
man who had bullied and threatened her for three
terrible months and forced her to marry him had no
right to a thrill of her heart nor a look from her
eyes, be he ever so kind for the moment. He certainly
was nice and pleasant when he chose to be; she
must watch herself, for never, never, must she yield
weakly to his smooth overtures. Well did she know
him. He had some reason for all this pleasantness.
It would surely be revealed soon.</p>

<p>She stiffened her lips and tried to look away from
him to the purply-green hills; but the echo of his
words came upon her again, and again her heart
thrilled at them. What if—oh what if he were all
right, and she might accept the admiration in his
voice? And yet how could that be possible? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
sweet color came into her cheeks again, and the tears
flew quickly to her eyes, till they looked all sky and
dew, and she dared not turn back to him.</p>

<p>The silence remained unbroken, until a lark in the
willow copse behind them burst forth into song and
broke the spell that was upon them.</p>

<p>“Are you offended at what I said?” he asked
earnestly. “I am sorry if you did not like it. The
words said themselves without my stopping to think
whether you might not like it. Will you forgive
me?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, lifting her forget-me-not eyes
to his, “I am not offended. There is nothing to
forgive. It was—beautiful!”</p>

<p>Then his eyes spoke the compliment over again,
and the thrill started anew in her heart, till her cheeks
grew quite rosy, and she buried her face in the coolness
of the tiny flowers to hide her confusion.</p>

<p>“It was very true,” he said in a low, lover-like
voice that sounded like a caress.</p>

<p>“Oughtn’t we to hurry on to catch our train?”
said Celia, suddenly springing to her feet. “I’m
quite rested now.” She felt if she stayed there another
moment she would yield to the spell he had cast
upon her.</p>

<p>With a dull thud of consciousness the man got
himself to his feet and reminded himself that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
was another man’s promised wife to whom he had
been letting his soul go out.</p>

<p>“Don’t let anything hinder you! Don’t let
anything hinder you!” suddenly babbled out the
little brook, and he gathered up his suit-cases and
started on.</p>

<p>“I am going to carry my suit-case,” declared a
very decided voice behind him, and a small hand
Seized hold of its handle.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, you are not!” declared
Gordon in a much more determined voice.</p>

<p>“But they are too heavy for you—both of them—and
the umbrella too,” she protested. “Give me
the umbrella then.”</p>

<p>But he would not give her even the umbrella,
rejoicing in his strength to shield her and bear her
burdens. As she walked beside him, she remembered
vividly a morning when George Hayne had made
her carry two heavy baskets, that his hands might
be free to shoot birds. Could this be the same
George Hayne?</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a happy walk, and far shorter
than either had expected it to be, though Gordon
worried not a little about his frail companion before
they came to the outskirts of the village, and kept
begging her to sit down and rest again, but she
would not. She was quite eager and excited about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the strange village to which they were coming. Its
outlying farm-houses were all so clean and white,
with green blinds folded placidly over their front
windows, and only their back doors astir. The cows
all looked peaceful, and the dogs all seemed friendly.</p>

<p>They walked up the village street, shaded in
patches with flecks of sunshine through the young
leaves. If anyone had told Celia Hathaway the
night before that she would have walked and talked
thus to-day with her bridegroom she would have
laughed him to scorn. But now all unconsciously
she had drifted into an attitude of friendliness with
the man whom she had thought to hate all the rest
of her life.</p>

<p>One long, straight, maple-lined street, running
parallel to the stream, comprised the village. They
walked to the centre of it, and still saw no signs of a
restaurant. A post-office, a couple of stores and a
bakery made up the business portion of the town,
and upon enquiry it appeared that there was no
public eating house, the one hotel of the place having
been sold at auction the week before on account of
the death of the owner. The early village loungers
stared disinterestedly at the phenomenal appearance
in their midst of a couple of city folks with
their luggage and no apparent means of transit except
their two delicately shod feet. It presented a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
problem too grave to be solved unassisted, and
there were solemn shakings of the head over them.
At last one who had discouragingly stated the village
lack of a public inn asked casually:</p>

<p>“Hed a runaway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” laughed Gordon pleasantly. “We
didn’t travel with horses.”</p>

<p>“Hed a puncture, then,” announced the village
wiseacre, shifting from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>“Wal, you come the wrong direction to git help,”
said another languid listener. “Thur ain’t no garridge
here. The feller what uset to keep it skipped
out with Sam Galt’s wife a month ago. You’d
ought to ’a’ turned back to Ashville. They got a
good blacksmith there can tinker ye up.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Gordon interestedly. “Well
now that’s too bad, but perhaps as it can’t be helped
we’ll have to forget it. What’s the next town on
ahead and how far?”</p>

<p>“Sugar Grove’s two mile further on, and Milton’s
five. They’ve got a garridge and a rest’rant to
Milton, but that’s only sence the railroad built a
junction there.”</p>

<p>“Has anyone here a conveyance I could hire
to take us to Milton?” questioned Gordon, looking
anxiously about the indolent group.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to drive to Milton for less’n<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
five dollars,” declared a lazy youth after a suitable
pause.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Gordon. “How soon can you
be ready, and what sort of a rig have you? Will
it be comfortable for the lady?”</p>

<p>The youth eyed the graceful woman in her dainty
city dress scornfully. His own country lass was
dressed far prettier to his mind; but the eyes of her,
so blue, like the little weed-flowers at her breast,
went to his head. His tongue was suddenly tied.</p>

<p>“It’s all right! It’s as good’s you’ll get!” volunteered
a sullen-faced man half sitting on a sugar
barrel. He was of a type who preferred to see
fashionable ladies uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The youth departed for his “team” and after
some enquiries Gordon found that he might be able
to persuade the owner of the tiny white colonial cot
across the street to prepare a “snack” for himself
and his companion, so they went across the street
and waited fifteen minutes in a dank little hair-cloth
parlor adorned in funeral wreaths and knit tidies,
for a delicious breakfast of poached eggs, coffee,
home-made bread, butter like roses, and a comb of
amber honey. To each the experience was a new
one, and they enjoyed it together like two children,
letting their eyes speak volumes of comments in
the midst of the old lady’s volubility. Unconsciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
by their experiences they were being brought into
sympathy with each other.</p>

<p>The “rig” when it arrived at the door driven
by the blushing youth proved to be a high spring wagon
with two seats. In the front one the youth
lounged without a thought of assisting his passengers.
Gordon swung the baggage up, and then lifted
the girl into the back seat, himself taking the place
beside her, and planting a firm hand and arm behind
the backless seat, that she might feel more secure.</p>

<p>That ride, with his arm behind her, was just
one more link in the pretty chain of sympathy that
was being welded about these two. Unconsciously
more and more she began to droop, until when she
grew very tired he seemed to know at once.</p>

<p>“Just lean against my arm,” he said. “You
must be very tired and it will help you bear the
jolting.” He spoke as if his arm were made of wood
or iron, and was merely one of his belongings, like
an umbrella or suit-case. He made it seem quite the
natural thing for her to lean against him. If he had
claimed it as her right and privilege as wife, she
would have recoiled from him for recalling to her
the hated relation, and would have sat straight as a
bean-pole the rest of the way, but, as it was, she
sank back a trifle deprecatingly, and realized that it
was a great help. In her heart she thanked him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
making it possible for her to rest without entirely
compromising her attitude toward him. There was
nothing about it that suggested anything lover-like;
it seemed just a common courtesy.</p>

<p>Yet the strong arm almost trembled as he felt the
precious weight against it, and he wished that the
way were ten miles instead of five. Once, as Celia
leaned forward to point to a particularly lovely bit
of view that opened up as they wound around a
curve in the road, they ran over a stone, and the
wagon gave an unexpected jolt. Gordon reached
his hand out to steady her, and she settled back to
his arm with a sense of safety and being cared for
that was very pleasant. Looking up shyly, she saw
his eyes upon her, with that deep look of admiration
and something more, and again that strange thrill of
joy that had come when he gave her the forget-me-nots
swept through her. She felt almost as if she
were harboring a sinful thought when she remembered
the letters he had written; but the joy of the
day, and the sweetness of happiness for even a
moment, when she had been for so long a time sad,
was so pleasant that she let herself enjoy it and
drift, refusing to think evil of him now, here, in
this bright day. Thus like children on a picnic, they
passed through Sugar Grove and came to the town
of Milton, and there they bade their driver good-by,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
rewarding him with a crisp five-dollar bill. He drove
home with a vision of smiles in forget-me-not eyes,
and a marked inability to tell anything about his
wonderful passengers who had filled the little village
with awe and amazement, and had given no clue
to anyone as to who or what they were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to go back to the pursuer, in his berth, baffled
and frantic and raging. With hands that fumbled
because of their very eagerness he sought to get
into his garments, and find his shoes from the melée
of blankets and other articles in the berth, all the
time keeping one eye out of the window, for he
must not let his prey get away from him now. He
must watch and see what they were going to do.
How fortunate that he had wakened in time for that.
At least he would have a clue. Where was this?
A station?</p>

<p>He stopped operations once more to gaze off at
the landscape, a desolate country scene to his city
hardened eyes. Not a house in sight, nor a station.
The spires of the distant village seemed like a mirage
to him. This couldn’t be a station. What were
those two doing down there anyway? Dared he
risk calling the conductor and having him hold
them? No, this affair must be kept absolutely quiet.
Mr. Holman had said that if a breath of the matter
came out it was worse than death for all concerned.
He must just get off this train as fast as he could
and follow them if they were getting away. It might
be he could get the man in a lonely place—it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
be easy enough to watch his chance and gag the
lady—he had done such things before. He felt far
more at home in such an affair than he had the night
before at the Holman dinner-table. What a pity
one of the others had not come along. It would be
mere child’s play for two to handle those two who
looked as if they would turn frightened at the first
threat. However, he felt confident that he could
manage the affair alone.</p>

<p>He panted with haste and succeeded in getting
the wrong legs into his trousers and having to begin
all over again, his efforts greatly hampered by
the necessity for watching out the window.</p>

<p>Then came the distant rumble of an oncoming
train, and an answering scream from his own engine.
The two on the ground had crossed quickly over the
second track and were looking down the steep embankment.
Were they going down there? What
fate that he was not ready to follow them at once!
The train that was coming would pass—their own
would start—and he could not get out. His opportunity
was going from him and he could not find his
shoes!</p>

<p>Well what of it? He would go without! What
were shoes in a time like this? Surely he could get
along barefoot, and beg a pair at some farmhouse,
or buy a pair at a country store. He must get out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
at any cost, shoes or no shoes. Grasping his coat
which contained his money and valuables he sprang
from his berth straight into the arms of the porter
who was hurrying back to his car after having been
out to gossip with a brakeman over the delay.</p>

<p>“What’s de mattah, sah?” asked the astonished
porter, rallying quickly from the shock and assuming
his habitual courtesy.</p>

<p>“My shoes!” roared the irate traveller. “What
have you done with my shoes?”</p>

<p>“Quiet, sah, please sah, you’ll wake de whole
cyah,” said the porter. “I put yoh shoes under de
berth sah, right whar I allus puts ’em aftah blackin’
sah.”</p>

<p>The porter stooped and extracted the shoes from
beneath the curtain and the traveller, whose experience
in Pullmans was small, grabbed them furiously
and made for the door, shoes in hand, for with a
snort and a lurch and a preliminary jar the train
had taken up its motion, and a loud rushing outside
proclaimed that the other train was passing.</p>

<p>The porter, feeling that he had been treated with
injustice, stood gazing reproachfully after the man
for a full minute before he followed him to tell him
that the wash-room was at the other end of the car
and not down past the drawing-room as he evidently
supposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>He found his man standing in stocking feet on
the cold iron platform, his head out of the opening
left in the vestibuled train, for when the porter came
in he had drawn shut the outer door and slammed
down the movable platform, making it impossible
for anyone to get out. There was only the little
opening the size of a window above the grating
guard, and the man clung to it as if he would jump
over it if he only dared. He was looking back over
the track and his face was not good to see.</p>

<p>He turned wildly upon the porter.</p>

<p>“I want you to stop this train and let me off,” he
shouted. “I’ve lost something valuable back there
on the track. Stop the train quick, I tell you, or I’ll
sue the railroad.”</p>

<p>“What was it you lost?” asked the porter respectfully.
He wasn’t sure but the man was half
asleep yet.</p>

<p>“It was a—my—why it was a very valuable
paper. It means a fortune to me and several other
people and I must go back and get it. Stop the train,
I tell you, at once or I’ll jump out.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stop de train sah, you’ll hev to see de
conductah sah, ’bout dat. But I specks there’s
mighty little prospec’ o’ gettin’ dis train stopped
foh it gits to its destinashun sah. We’s one hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
a’hind time now, sah, an’ he’s gotta make up foh
we gits to Buff’lo.”</p>

<p>The excited passenger railed and stormed until
several sleepers were awakened and stuck curious
sleepy countenances out from the curtains of their
berths, but the porter was obdurate, and would not
take any measures to stop the train, nor even call
the conductor until the passenger promised to return
quietly to his berth.</p>

<p>The thick-set man was not used to obeying but
he saw that he was only hindering himself and
finally hurried back to his berth where he hastily
parted the curtains, craning his neck to see back
along the track and over the green valley growing
smaller and smaller now in the distance. He could
just make out two moving specks on the white winding
ribbon of the road. He felt sure he knew the
direction they were taking. If he only could get
off that train he could easily catch them, for they
would have no idea he was coming, and would take
no precautions. If he had only wakened a few
seconds sooner he would have been following them
even now.</p>

<p>Fully ten minutes he argued with the conductor,
showing a wide incongruity between his language
and his gentlemanly attire, but the conductor would
do nothing but promise to set him down at a water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
tower ten miles ahead where they had to slow up for
water. He said sue or no sue he had his orders,
and the thick-set man did not inspire him either to
sympathy or confidence. The conductor had been
many years on the road and generally knew when to
stop his train and when to let it go on.</p>

<p>Sullenly the thick-set man accepted the conductor’s
decision and prepared to leave the train at the
water tower, his eye out for the landmarks along
the way as he completed his hasty toilet.</p>

<p>He was in no pleasant frame of mind, having
missed a goodly amount of his accustomed stimulants
the night before, and seeing little prospect of
either stimulants or breakfast before him. He was
not built for a ten-mile walk over the cinders and
his flabby muscles already ached at the prospect.
But then, of course he would not have to go far before
he found an automobile or some kind of conveyance
to help him on his way. He looked eagerly
from the window for indications of garages or
stables, but the river wound its silver way among the
gray green willow fringes, and the new grass shone
a placid emerald plain with nothing more human
than a few cows grazing here and there. Not even
a horse that might be borrowed without his owner’s
knowledge. It was a strange, forsaken spot, ten
whole miles and no sign of any public livery! Off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
to the right and left he could see villages, but they
were most of them too far away from the track to
help him any. It began to look as if he must
just foot it all the way. Now and then a small
shanty or tiny dwelling whizzed by near at hand, but
nothing that would relieve his situation.</p>

<p>It occurred to him to go into the dining-car for
breakfast, but even as he thought of it the conductor
told him that the train would stop in two minutes and
he must be ready to get off, for they did not stop
long.</p>

<p>He certainly looked a harmless creature, that
thick-set man as he stood alone upon the cinder elevation
and surveyed the landscape o’er. Ten miles
from his quarry, alone on a stretch of endless ties
and rails with a gleaming river mocking him down
in the valley, and a laughing sky jeering overhead.
He started down the shining track his temper a
wreck, his mind in chaos, his soul at war with the
world. The worst of it all was that the whole fault
was his own for going to sleep. He began to fear
that he had lost his chance. Then he set his ugly
jaw and strode ahead.</p>

<p>The morning sun poured down upon the thick-set
man on his pilgrimage, and waxed hotter until noon.
Trains whizzed mercilessly by and gave him no succor.
Weary, faint, and fiercely thirsty he came at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
last to the spot where he was satisfied his quarry had
escaped. He could see the marks of their rough
descent in the steep cinder bank, and assaying the
same himself came upon a shred of purple silk caught
on a bramble at the foot.</p>

<p>Puffing and panting, bruised and foot-sore, he
sat down at the very place where Celia had stopped
to have her shoes fastened, and mopped his purple
brow, but there was triumph in his ugly eye, and
after a few moment’s rest he trudged onward. That
town over there ought to yield both conveyance and
food as well as information concerning those he
sought. He would catch them. They could never
get away from him. He was on their track again,
though hours behind. He would get them yet and
no man should take his reward from him.</p>

<p>Almost spent he came at last to the village, and
ate a surprisingly large dish of beef and vegetable
stew at the quaint little house where Celia and Gordon
had breakfasted, but the old lady who served
it to them was shy about talking, and though admitting
that a couple of people had been there that morning
she was non-committal about their appearance.
They might have been young and good-looking and
worn feathers in their hats, and they might not.
She wasn’t one for noticing people’s appearance if
they treated her civilly and paid their bills. Would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
he have another cup of coffee? He would, and also
two more pieces of pie, but he got very little further
information.</p>

<p>It was over at the corner store where he finally
went in search of something stronger than coffee
that he further pursued his investigations.</p>

<p>The loungers were still there. It was their only
business in life and they were most diligent in it.
They eyed the newcomer with a relish and settled
back on their various barrels and boxes to enjoy
whatever entertainment the gods were about to provide
to relieve their monotonous existence.</p>

<p>A house divided against itself cannot stand. This
man’s elegant garments assumed for the nonce did
not fit the rest of his general appearance which had
been accentuated by his long, hot, dusty tramp. The
high evening hat was jammed on the back of his head
and bore a decided dent where it had rolled down the
cinder embankment, his collar was wilted and lifeless,
his white laundered tie at half mast, his coat
awry, and his fine patent leather shoes which
pinched were covered with dust and had caused a
limp like the hardest tramp upon the road. Moreover,
again the speech of the man betrayed him, and
the keen-minded old gossips who were watching him
suspiciously sized him up at once the minute he
opened his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Saw anything of a couple of young folks walking
down this way?” he enquired casually, pausing
to light a cigar with which he was reinforcing himself
for further travel.</p>

<p>One man allowed that there might have passed
such people that day. He hardly seemed willing to
commit himself, but another vouchsafed the information
that “Joe here driv two parties of thet
description to Milton this mornin’—jes’ got back.
Mebbe he could answer fer ’em.”</p>

<p>Joe frowned. He did not like the looks of the
thick-set man. He still remembered the forget-me-not
eyes.</p>

<p>But the stranger made instant request to be
driven to Milton, offering ten dollars for the same
when he found that his driver was reluctant, and
that Milton was a railroad centre. A few keen questions
had made him sure that his man had gone to
Milton.</p>

<p>Joe haggled, allowed his horse was tired, and he
didn’t care about the trip twice in one day, but finally
agreed to take the man for fifteen dollars, and sauntered
off to get a fresh horse. He had no mind to
be in a hurry. He had his own opinion about letting
those two “parties” get out of the way before the
third put in an appearance, but he had no mind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
lose the fifteen dollars. It would help to buy the
ring he coveted for his girl.</p>

<p>In due time Joe rode leisurely up and the impatient
traveller climbed into the high spring wagon
and was driven away from the apathetic gaze of the
country loungers, who unblinkingly took in the fact
that Joe was headed toward Ashville, and evidently
intended taking his fare to Milton by way of that
village, a thirty-mile drive at least. The man would
get the worth of his money in ride. A grim twinkle
sat in their several eyes as the spring wagon turned
the curve in the road and was lost to sight, and
after due silence an old stager spoke:</p>

<p>“Do you reckon that there was their sho-fur?”
he requested languidly.</p>

<p>“Naw!” replied a farmer’s son vigorously.
“He wouldn’t try to showf all dolled up like that.
He’s the rich dad comin’ after the runaways. Joe
don’t intend he shell get ’em yet awhile. I reckon
the ceremony’ll be over ’fore he steps in to interfere.”
This lad went twice a month to Milton to
the “movies” and was regarded as an authority
on matters of romance. A pause showed that his
theory had taken root in the minds of his auditors.</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckon Joe thinks the longest way round
is the shortest way home,” declared the old stager.
“Joe never did like them cod-fish swells—but how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
do you ’count fer the style o’ that gal? She wan’t
like her dad one little bit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s ben to collidge I ’spose,” declared
the youth. “They get all that off’n collidge.”</p>

<p>“Serves the old man right fer sendin’ his gal to
a fool collidge when she ought to a ben home learnin’
to house-keep. I hope she gits off with her young
man all right,” said a grim old lounger, and a cackle
of laughter went round the group, which presently
broke up, for this had been a strenuous day and
all felt their need of rest; besides they wanted to
get home and tell the news before some neighbor got
ahead of them.</p>

<p>All this time Celia and Gordon were touring
Milton, serenely unconscious of danger near, or
guardian angel of the name of Joe.</p>

<p>Investigation disclosed the fact that there was a
train for Pittsburgh about three in the afternoon.
Gordon sent a code telegram to his chief, assuring
him of the safety of the message, and of his own
intention to proceed to Washington as fast as steam
could carry him. Then he took the girl to a restaurant,
where they mounted two high stools, and partook
with an unusually ravenous appetite of nearly
everything on the menu—corn soup, roast beef,
baked trout, stewed tomatoes, cold slaw, custard,
apple, and mince pies, with a cup of good country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
coffee and real cream—all for twenty-five cents
apiece.</p>

<p>It was a very merry meal. Celia felt somehow
as if for the time all memory of the past had been
taken from her, and she were free to think and act
happily in the present, without any great problems
to solve or decisions to make. Just two young
people off having a good time, they were, at least
until that afternoon train came.</p>

<p>After their dinner, they took a short walk to a
tiny park where two white ducks disported themselves
on a seven-by-nine pond, spanned by a rustic
bridge where lovers had cut their initials. Gordon
took out his knife and idly cut C. H. in the rough
bark of the upper rail, while his companion sat on
the little board seat and watched him. She was pondering
over the fact that he had cut her initials, and
not his own. It would have been like the George of
old to cut his own and never once think of hers.
And he had put but one H. Probably he thought of
her now as Celia Hayne, without the Hathaway, or
else he was so used to writing her name Celia Hathaway,
that he was not thinking at all.</p>

<p>Those letters! How they haunted her and clouded
every bright experience that she fain would have
grasped and held for a little hour.</p>

<p>They were silent now, while he worked and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
she thought. He had finished the C. H., and was cutting
another C, but instead of making another H,
he carefully carved out the letter G. What was
that for? C. G.? Who was C. G.? Oh, how
stupid! George, of course. He had started a C
by mistake. But he did not add the expected H. Instead
he snapped his knife shut, laid his hand over
the carving, and leaned over the rail.</p>

<p>“Some time, perhaps, we’ll come here again,
and remember,” he said, and then bethought him
that he had no right to hope for any such anniversary.</p>

<p>“Oh!” She looked up into his eyes, startled,
troubled, the haunting of her fears in the shadows
of the blue.</p>

<p>He looked down into them and read her trouble,
read and understood, and looked back his great
desire to comfort her.</p>

<p>His look carried further than he meant it should.
For the third time that day a thrill of wonder
and delight passed over her and left her fearful
with a strange joy that she felt she should put from
her.</p>

<p>It was only an instant, that look, but it brought
the bright color to both faces, and made Gordon
feel the immediate necessity of changing the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“See those little fishes down there,” he said
pointing to the tiny lake below them.</p>

<p>Through a blur of tears, the girl looked down
and saw the tiny, sharp-finned creatures darting here
and there in a beam of sun like a small search-light
set to show them off.</p>

<p>She moved her hand on the rail to lean further
over, and her soft fingers touched his hand for a
moment. She would not draw them away quickly,
lest she hurt him; why, she did not know, but she
could not—would not—hurt him. Not now! The
two hands lay side by side for a full minute, and the
touch to Gordon was as if a roseleaf had kissed his
soul. He had never felt anything sweeter. He
longed to gather the little hand into his clasp and
feel its pulses trembling there as he had felt it in
the church the night before, but she was not his. He
might not touch her till she had her choice of what
to do, and she would never choose him, never, when
she knew how he had deceived her.</p>

<p>That one supreme moment they had of perfect
consciousness, consciousness of the drawing of soul
to soul, of the sweetness of that hovering touch of
hands, of the longing to know and understand each
other.</p>

<p>Then a sharp whistle sounded, and a farmer’s
boy with a new rake and a sack of corn on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
shoulder came sauntering briskly down the road to
the bridge. Instantly they drew apart, and Celia
felt that she had been on the verge of disloyalty to
her true self.</p>

<p>They walked silently back to the station, each
busy with his own thoughts, each conscious of that
one moment when the other had come so near.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were a lot of people at the station. They
had been to a family gathering of some sort from
their remarks, and they talked loudly and much, so
that the two stood apart—for the seats were all
occupied—and had no opportunity for conversation,
save a quiet smiling comment now and then
upon the chatter about them, or the odd remarks
they heard.</p>

<p>There had come a constraint upon them, a withdrawing
of each into his shell, each conscious of
something that separated. Gordon struggled to prevent
it, but he seemed helpless. Celia would smile
in answer to his quiet remarks, but it was a smile
of distance, such as she had worn early in the morning.
She had quite found her former standing
ground, with its fence of prejudice, and she was
repairing the breaks through which she had gone
over to the enemy during the day. She was bracing
herself with dire reminders, and snatches from
those terrible letters which were written in characters
of fire in her heart. Never, never, could she
care for a man who had done what this man had
done. She had forgotten for a little while those
terrible things he had said of her dear dead father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
How could she have forgotten for an instant! How
could she have let her hand lie close to the hand
that had defiled itself by writing such things!</p>

<p>By the time they were seated in the train, she was
freezing in her attitude, and poor Gordon sat miserably
beside her and tried to think what he had done
to offend her. It was not his fault that her hand had
lain near his on the rail. She had put it there herself.
Perhaps she expected him to put his over it,
to show her that he cared as a bridegroom should
care—as he did care, in reality, if he only had the
right. And perhaps she was hurt that he had stood
coolly and said or done nothing. But he could
not help it.</p>

<p>Much to Gordon’s relief, the train carried a parlor-car,
and it happened on this particular day to be
almost deserted save for a deaf old man with a florid
complexion and a gold knobbed cane who slumbered
audibly at the further end from the two chairs
Gordon selected. He established his companion
comfortably, disposed of the baggage, and sat down,
but the girl paid no heed to him. With a sad, set
face, she stared out of the window, her eyes seeming
to see nothing. For two hours she sat so, he making
remarks occasionally, to which she made little or
no reply, until he lapsed into silence, looking at
her with troubled eyes. Finally, just as they neared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the outskirts of Pittsburgh, he leaned softly forward
and touched her coat-sleeve, to attract her
attention.</p>

<p>“Have I offended—hurt—you in any way?”
he asked gently. She turned toward him, and her
eyes were brimming full of tears.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, and her lips were trembling.
“No, you have been—most—kind—but—but I cannot
forget <i>those letters</i>!” She ended with a sob
and put up her handkerchief quickly to stifle it.</p>

<p>“Letters?” he asked helplessly. “What
letters?”</p>

<p>“The letters you wrote me. All the letters of
the last five months. I cannot forget them. I can
<i>never</i> forget them! How could you <i>think</i> I could?”</p>

<p>He looked at her anxiously, not knowing what
to say, and yet he must say something. The time
had come when some kind of an understanding, some
clearing up of facts, must take place. He must go
cautiously, but he must find out what was the matter.
He could not see her suffer so. There must
be some way to let her know that so far as he was
concerned she need suffer nothing further and that
he would do all in his power to set her right with
her world.</p>

<p>But letters! He had written no letters. His face
lighted up with the swift certainty of one thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
about which he had not dared to be sure. She still
thought him the man she had intended to marry.
She was not therefore troubled about that phase of
the question. It was strange, almost unbelievable,
but it was true that he personally was not responsible
for the trouble in her eyes. What trouble she
might feel when she knew all, he had yet to find out,
but it was a great relief to be sure of so much. Still,
something must be said.</p>

<p>“Letters!” he repeated again stupidly, and then
added with perplexed tone: “Would you mind telling
me just what it was in the letters that hurt
you?”</p>

<p>She turned eyes of astonishment on him.</p>

<p>“How can you ask?” she said almost bitterly.
“You surely must know how terrible they were to
me! You could not be the man you have seemed
to be to-day if you did not know what you were
doing to me in making all those terrible threats.
You must know how cruel they were.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I don’t understand,” he said earnestly,
the trouble still most apparent in his eyes,
“Would you mind being a little more explicit?
Would you mind telling me exactly what you think
I wrote you that sounded like a threat?”</p>

<p>He asked the question half hesitatingly, because
he was not quite sure whether he was justified in thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
obtaining private information under false pretenses,
and yet he felt that he must know just what troubled
her or he could never help her; and he was sure that
if she knew he was an utter stranger, even a kindly
one, those gentle lips would never open to inform
him upon her torturer. As it was she could tell him
her trouble with a perfectly clear conscience, thinking
she was telling it to the man who knew all
about it. But his hesitation about prying into an
utter stranger’s private affairs even with a good
motive, gave him an air of troubled dignity, and
real anxiety to know his fault that puzzled the girl
more than all that had gone before.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand how you can ask such a
question, since it has been the constant subject of
discussion in all our letters!” she replied, sitting up
with asperity and drying her tears. She was on the
verge of growing angry with him for his petty, wilful
misunderstanding of words whose meaning she felt
he must know well.</p>

<p>“I do ask it,” he said quietly, “and, believe me,
I have a good motive in doing so.”</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. It was impossible
to be angry with those kindly eyes, even though he
did persist in a wilful stupidity.</p>

<p>“Well, then, since you wish it stated once more
I will tell you,” she declared, the tears welling again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
into her eyes. “You first demanded that I marry
you—demanded—without any pretense whatever of
caring for me—with a hidden threat in your demand
that if I did not, you would bring some dire calamity
upon me by means that were already in your power.
You took me for the same foolish little girl whom
you had delighted to tease for years before you went
abroad to live. And when I refused you, you told
me that you could not only take away from my
mother all the property which she had inherited
from her brother, by means of a will made just
before my uncle’s death, and unknown except to his
lawyer and you; but that you could and would
blacken my dear dead father’s name and honor, and
show that every cent that belonged to Mother and
Jefferson and myself was stolen property. When
I challenged you to prove any such thing against my
honored father, you went still further and threatened
to bring out a terrible story and prove it with
witnesses who would swear to anything you said.
You knew my father’s white life, you as much as
owned your charges were false, and yet you dared
to send me a letter from a vile creature who pretended
that she was his first wife, and who said
she could prove that he had spent much of his time
in her company. You knew the whole thing was
a falsehood, but you dared to threaten to make this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
known through the newspapers if I did not marry
you. You realized that I knew that, even though few
people and no friends would believe such a thing of
my father, such a report in the papers—false though
it was—would crush my mother to death. You
knew that I would give my life to save her, and so
you had me in your power, as you have me now.
You have always wanted me in your power, just
because you love to torture, and now you have me.
But you cannot make me forget what you have
done. I have given my life but I cannot give any
more. If it is not sufficient you will have to do your
worst.”</p>

<p>She dropped her face into the little wet handkerchief,
and Gordon sat with white, drawn countenance
and clenched hands. He was fairly trembling
with indignation toward the villain who had thus
dared impose upon this delicate flower of womanhood.
He longed to search the world over for the
false bridegroom; and, finding, give him his just
dues.</p>

<p>And what should he do or say? Dared he tell
her at once who he was and trust to her kind heart
to forgive his terrible blunder and keep his secret till
the message was safely delivered? Dared he? Had
he any right? No, the secret was not his to divulge
either for his own benefit or for any other’s. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
must keep that to himself. But he must help her
in some way.</p>

<p>At last he began to speak, scarcely knowing what
he was about to say:</p>

<p>“It is terrible, <i>terrible</i>, what you have told me.
To have written such things to one like you—in fact,
to anyone on earth—seems to me unforgivable. It
is the most inhuman cruelty I have ever heard of.
You are fully justified in hating and despising the
man who wrote such words to you.”</p>

<p>“Then, why did you write them?” she burst
forth. “And how can you sit there calmly and
talk that way about it, as if you had nothing to do
with the matter?”</p>

<p>“Because I never wrote those letters,” he said,
looking her steadily, earnestly, in the eyes.</p>

<p>“You never wrote them!” she exclaimed excitedly.
“You dare to deny it?”</p>

<p>“I dare to deny it.” His voice was quiet, earnest,
convincing.</p>

<p>She looked at him, dazed, bewildered, indignant,
sorrowful. “But you cannot deny it,” she said, her
fragile frame trembling with excitement. “I have
the letters all in my suit-case. You cannot deny
your own handwriting. I have the last awful one—the
one in which you threatened Father’s good name—here
in my hand-bag. I dared not put it with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
rest, and I had no opportunity to destroy it before
leaving home. I felt as if I must always keep it with
me, lest otherwise its awful secret would somehow
get out. There it is. Read it and see your own name
signed to the words you say you did not write!”</p>

<p>While she talked, her trembling fingers had
taken a folded, crumpled letter from her little hand-bag,
and this she reached over and laid upon the
arm of his chair.</p>

<p>“Read it,” she said. “Read it and see that
you cannot deny it.”</p>

<p>“I should rather not read it,” he said. “I do
not need to read it to deny that I ever wrote such
things to you.”</p>

<p>“But I insist that you read it,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“If you insist I will read it,” he said, taking the
letter reluctantly and opening it.</p>

<p>She sat watching him furtively through the tears
while he read, saw the angry flush steal into his
cheeks as the villainy of a fellow man was revealed
to him through the brief, coarse, cruel epistle, and
she mistook the flush for one of shame.</p>

<p>Then his true brown eyes looked up and met her
tearful gaze steadily, a fine anger burning in them.</p>

<p>“And you think I wrote that!” he said, a something
in his voice she could not understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“What else could I think? It bears your signature,”
she answered coldly.</p>

<p>“The letter is vile,” he said, “and the man who
wrote it is a blackguard, and deserves the utmost that
the law allows for such offences. With your permission,
I shall make it my business to see that he gets it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she said, wide-eyed.
“How could you punish yourself? You cannot still
deny that you wrote the letter.”</p>

<p>“I still deny that I wrote it, or ever saw it until
you handed it to me just now.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him, nonplussed, more than
half convinced, in spite of reason.</p>

<p>“But isn’t that your handwriting?”</p>

<p>“It is not. Look!”</p>

<p>He took out his fountain pen, and, holding the
letter on the arm of her chair, he wrote rapidly in his
natural hand her own name and address beneath the
address on the envelope, then held it up to her.</p>

<p>“Do they look alike?”</p>

<p>The two writings were as utterly unlike as possible,
the letter being addressed in an almost unreadable
scrawl, and the fresh writing standing fine and
clear, in a script that spoke of character and business
ability. Even a child could see at a glance that the
two were not written by the same hand—and yet
of course, it might have been practised for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
of deception. This thought flashed through
the minds of both even as he held it out for her
to look.</p>

<p>She looked from the envelope to his eyes and back
to the letter, startled, not knowing what to think.</p>

<p>But before either of them had time for another
word the conductor, the porter, and several people
from the car behind came hurriedly through, and
they realized that while they talked the train had
come to a halt, amid the blazing electric lights of
a great city station.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Gordon, startled, “we must have
reached Pittsburgh. Is this Pittsburgh?” he called
out to the vanishing porter.</p>

<p>“Yas sah!” yelled the porter, putting his head
around the curve of the passageway. “You bettah
hurry sah, foh dis train goes on to Cincinnati pretty
quick. We’s late gittin’ in you see.”</p>

<p>Neither of them had noticed a man in rough
clothes with slouch hat and hands in his pockets
who had boarded the train a few miles back and
walked through the car several times eyeing them
keenly. He stuck his head in at the door now furtively
and drew back quickly again out of sight.</p>

<p>Gordon hurriedly gathered up the baggage, and
they went out of the car, the porter rushing back as
they reached the door, to assist them and get a last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
tip. There was no opportunity to say anything more,
as they mingled with the crowd, until the porter
landed their baggage in the great station and hurried
back to his train. The man with the slouch hat followed
and stood unobtrusively behind them.</p>

<p>Gordon looked down at the white, drawn face
of the girl, and his heart was touched with compassion
for her trouble. He must make her some satisfactory
explanation at once that would set her heart
at rest, but he could not do it here, for every seat
about them was filled with noisy chattering folk. He
stooped and whispered low and tenderly:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, little girl! Just try to trust me,
and I will explain it all.”</p>

<p>“Can you explain it?” she asked anxiously, as
if catching at a rope thrown out to save her life.</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” he said, “if you will be patient and
trust me. But we cannot talk here. Just wait in this
seat until I see if I can get the stateroom on the
sleeper.”</p>

<p>He left her with his courteous bow, and she sat
watching his tall, fine figure as he threaded his way
among the crowds to the Pullman window, her heart
filled with mingling emotions. In spite of her
reason, a tiny bit of hope for the future was springing
up in her heart and without her own will she
found herself inclined to trust him. At least it was
all she could do at present.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Back</span> at Milton an hour before, when the shades
of dusk were falling and a slender moon hung
timidly on the edge of the horizon, a horse drawing
a spring wagon ambled deliberately into town and
came to a reluctant halt beside the railroad station,
having made a wide détour through the larger part
of the county on the way to that metropolis.</p>

<p>The sun had been hot, the road much of it rough,
and the jolts over stones and bumps had not added
to the comfort of the thick-set man, already bruised
and weary from his travels. Joe’s conversation had
not ceased. He had given his guest a wide range
of topics, discoursing learnedly on the buckwheat
crop and the blight that might be expected to assail
the cherry trees. He pointed out certain portions
of land infested with rattlesnakes, and told blood-curdling
stories of experiences with stray bears
and wild cats in a maple grove through which they
passed till the passenger looked furtively behind
him and urged the driver to hurry a little faster.</p>

<p>Joe, seeing his gullibility, only made his stories
of country life the bigger, for the thick-set man,
though bold as a lion in his own city haunts, was a
coward in the unknown world of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>When the traveler looking at his watch urged
Joe to make haste and asked how many miles further
Milton was, Joe managed it that the horse should
stumble on a particularly stony bit of road. Then
getting down gravely from the wagon he examined
the horse’s feet each in turn, shaking his head sadly
over the left fore foot.</p>

<p>“Jes’ ’z I ’sposed,” he meditated dreamily.
“Stone bruise! Lame horse! Don’t believe I ought
to go on. Sorry, but it’ll be the ruination of the
horse. You ain’t in a hurry I hope.”</p>

<p>The passenger in great excitement promised to
double the fare if the young man would get another
horse and hurry him forward, and after great professions
of doubt Joe gave in and said he would try
the horse, but it wouldn’t do to work him hard.
They would have to let him take his time. He
couldn’t on any account leave the horse behind anywhere
and get a fresh one because it belonged to his
best friend and he promised to bring it back safe and
sound. They would just take their time and go
slow and see if the horse could stand it. He wouldn’t
think of trying it if it weren’t for the extra money
which he needed.</p>

<p>So the impatient traveler was dragged fuming
along weary hour after weary hour through the
monotonous glory of a spring afternoon of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
he saw nothing but the dust of the road as he tried
to count the endless miles. Every mile or two Joe
would descend from the wagon seat and fuss around
the horse’s leg, the horse nothing loth at such unprecedented
attention dozing cozily by the roadside
during the process. And so was the traveler brought
to his destination ten minutes after the last train that
stopped at Milton that night had passed the station.</p>

<p>The telegraph office was not closed however, and
without waiting to haggle, the passenger paid his
thirty dollars for the longest journey he ever took,
and disappeared into the station, while Joe, whipping
up his petted animal, and whistling cheerily:</p>

<p class="center">“Where did you get that girl—?”</p>

<p>went rattling down the short cut from Milton
home at a surprising pace for a lame horse. He
was eating his supper at home in a little more than
an hour, and the horse seemed to have miraculously
recovered from his stone bruise. Joe was wondering
how his girl would look in a hat with purple
plumes, and thinking of his thirty dollars with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>It was surprising how much that thick-set man,
weary and desperate though he was, could accomplish,
when once he reached the telegraph station
and sent his messages flying on their way. In less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
than three minutes after his arrival he had extracted
from the station agent the fact that two people, man
and woman, answering the description he gave, had
bought tickets for Pittsburgh and taken the afternoon
train for that city. The agent had noticed
them on account of their looking as if they came
from the city. He especially noticed the purple
plumes, the like of which he had never seen before.
He had taken every minute he could get off from
selling tickets and sending telegrams to watch the
lady through his little cobwebby window. They
didn’t wear hats like that in Milton.</p>

<p>In ten minutes one message was on its way to
a crony in Pittsburgh with whom the thick-set man
kept in constant touch for just such occasions as
the present, stirring him to strenuous action; another
message had winged its mysterious way to Mr.
Holman, giving him the main facts in the case; while
a third message caught another crony thirty miles
north of Pittsburgh and ordered him to board the
evening express at his own station, hunt up the
parties described, and shadow them to their destination,
if possible getting in touch with the Pittsburgh
crony when he reached the city.</p>

<p>The pursuer then ate a ham sandwich with
liberal washings of liquid fire while he awaited replies
to some of his messages; and as soon as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
was satisfied that he had set justice in motion he
hired an automobile and hied him across country
to catch a midnight express to Pittsburgh. He had
given orders that his man and accompanying lady
should be held in Pittsburgh until his arrival, and
he had no doubt but that the orders would be carried
out, so sure was he that he was on the right
track, and that his cronies would be able and willing
to follow his orders.</p>

<p>There was some kind of an excursion on at
Pittsburgh, and the place was crowded. The trainmen
kept calling off specials, and crowds hurried
out of the waiting room, only to be replaced by other
crowds, all eager, pushing, talking, laughing. They
were mostly men, but a good many women and some
children seemed to be of the number; and the noise
and excitement worried her after her own exciting
afternoon. Celia longed to lay her down and sleep,
but the seat was narrow, and hard, and people were
pressing on every side. That disagreeable man in
the slouch hat would stand too near. He was most
repulsive looking, though he did not seem to be
aware of her presence.</p>

<p>Gordon had a long wait before he finally secured
the coveted stateroom and started back to her,
when suddenly a face that he knew loomed up in
the crowd and startled him. It was the face of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
private detective who was well known about Washington,
but whose headquarters were in New York.</p>

<p>Until that instant, it had not occurred to him to
fear watchers so far south and west as Pittsburgh.
It was not possible that the other bridegroom would
think to track him here, and, as for the Holman contingent,
they would not be likely to make a public
disturbance about his disappearance, lest they be
found to have some connection with the first theft
of government property. They could have watchers
only through private means, and they must have
been wily indeed if they had anticipated his move
through Pittsburgh to Washington. Still, it was the
natural move for him to make in order to get home
as quickly as possible and yet escape them. And
this man in the crowd was the very one whom they
would have been likely to pick out for their work.
He was as slippery in his dealings as they must be,
and no doubt was in league with them. He knew
the man and his ways thoroughly, and had no mind
to fall into his hands.</p>

<p>Whether he had been seen by the detective yet
or not, he could not tell, but he suspected he had, by
the way the man stood around and avoided recognizing
him. There was not an instant to be lost.
The fine stateroom must go untenanted. He must
make a dash for liberty. Liberty! Ah, East Liberty!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
what queer things these brains of ours are! He
knew Pittsburgh just a little. He remembered
having caught a train at East Liberty Station once
when he had not time to come down to the station
to take it. Perhaps he might get the same train at
East Liberty. It was nearly two hours before it
left.</p>

<p>Swooping down upon the baggage, he murmured
in the girl’s ear:</p>

<p>“Can you hurry a little? We must catch a car
right away.”</p>

<p>She followed him closely through the crowd, he
stooping as if to look down at his suit-case, so that
his height might not attract the attention of the
man whose recognition he feared, and in a moment
more they were out in the lighted blackness of the
streets. One glance backward showed his supposed
enemy stretching his neck above the crowd, as if
searching for some one, as he walked hurriedly toward
the very doorway they had just passed. Behind
them shadowed the man in the slouch hat, and
with a curious motion of his hand signalled another
like himself, the Pittsburgh crony, who skulked in
the darkness outside. Instantly this man gave another
signal and out of the gloom of the street a
carriage drew up at the curb before the door, the
cabman looking eagerly for patronage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Gordon put both suit-cases in one hand and taking
Celia’s arm as gently as he could in his haste hurried
her toward the carriage. It was the very refuge
he sought. He placed her inside and gave the order
for East Liberty Station, drawing a long breath of
relief at being safely out of the station. He
did not see the shabby one who mounted the box
beside the driver and gave his directions in guttural
whispers, nor the man with the slouch hat who
watched from the doorway and followed them
to a familiar haunt on the nearest car. He only
felt how good it was to be by themselves once more
where they could talk together without interruption.</p>

<p>But conversation was not easy under the circumstances.
The noise of wagons, trains and cars was
so great at the station that they could think of
nothing but the din, and when they had threaded
their way out of the tangle and started rattling over
the pavement the driver went at such a furious pace
that they could still only converse by shouting and
that not at all satisfactorily. It seemed a strange
thing that any cabman should drive at such a rapid
rate within the city limits, but as Gordon was anxious
to get away from the station and the keen-eyed
detective as fast as possible he thought nothing of
it at first. After a shouted word or two they ceased
to try to talk, and Gordon, half shyly, reached out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
a reassuring hand and laid it on the girl’s shrinking
one that lay in her lap. He had not meant to keep
it there but a second, just to make her understand
that all was well, and he would soon be able to explain
things, but as she did not seem to resent it,
nor draw her own away, he yielded to the temptation
and kept the small gloved hand in his.</p>

<p>The carriage rattled on, bumpety-bump, over
rough places, around corners, tilting now and then
sideways, and Celia, half-frightened, was forced to
cling to her protector to keep from being thrown on
the floor of the cab.</p>

<p>“Oh, are we running away?” she breathed awesomely
into his ear.</p>

<p>“I think not,—dear,” he answered back, the
last word inaudible. “The driver thinks we are in
a hurry but he has no need to go at this furious
pace. I will tell him.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and tapped on the glass, but
the driver paid no attention whatever save perhaps
to drive faster. Could it be that he had lost control
of his horse and could not stop, or hadn’t he
heard? Gordon tried again, and accompanied the
knocking this time with a shout, but all to no purpose.
The cab rattled steadily on. Gordon discovered
now that there were two men on the box instead
of one, and a sudden premonition sent a thrill of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
alarm through him. What if after all the presence
of that detective had been a warning, and he unheeding
had walked into a trap? What a fool he
had been to get into a carriage where he was at the
mercy of the driver. He ought to have stayed in
open places where kidnapping would be impossible.
Now that he had thought of it he felt convinced that
this was just what the enemy would try to do,—kidnap
him. The more fruitless he found his efforts
to make the driver hear him the more he felt convinced
that something was wrong. He tried to
open the door next him and found it stuck. He
put all his strength forth to turn the catch but it held
fast. Then a cold sweat stood out upon him and
horror filled his mind. His commission with its
large significance to the country was in imminent
jeopardy. His own life was in all probability hanging
in the balance, but most of all he felt the awful
peril of the sweet girl by his side. What terrible experiences
might be hers within the next hour if his
brain and right arm could not protect her. Instinctively
his hand went to the pocket where he had kept
his revolver ready since ever he had left Washington.
Danger should not find him utterly unprepared.</p>

<p>He realized, too, that it was entirely possible,
that his alarms were unfounded; that the driver was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
really taking them to the East Liberty station; that
the door merely stuck, and he was needlessly anxious.
He must keep a steady head and not let his
companion see that he was nervous. The first thing
was to find out if possible where they really were, but
that was a difficult task. The street over which they
rattled was utterly dark with the gloom of a smoky
city added to the night. There were no street lights
except at wide intervals, and the buildings appeared
to be blank walls of darkness, probably great warehouses.
The way was narrow, and entirely unknown.
Gordon could not tell if he had ever been
there before. He was sure from his knowledge of
the stations that they had gone much farther than
to East Liberty, and the darkness and loneliness of
the region through which they were passing filled
him again with a vague alarm. It occurred to him
that he might be able to get the window sash down
and speak to the driver, and he struggled with the one
on his own side for a while, with little result, for it
seemed to have been plugged up with wads of paper
all around. This fact renewed his anxiety. It began
to look as if there was intention in sealing up
that carriage. He leaned over and felt around the
sash of the opposite door and found the paper wads
there also. There certainly was intention. Not to
alarm Celia he straightened back and went to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
again at his own window sash cautiously pulling out
the paper until at last he could let down the glass.</p>

<p>A rush of dank air rewarded his efforts, and the
girl drew a breath of relief. Gordon never knew
how near she had been to fainting at that moment.
She was sitting perfectly quiet in her corner watching
him, her fears kept to herself, though her heart
was beating wildly. She was convinced that the
horse was running away.</p>

<p>Gordon leaned his head out of the window, but
immediately he caught the gleam of a revolver in
a hand that hung at the side of the driver’s box,
pointed downward straight toward his face as if
with intention to be ready in case of need. The
owner of the hand was not looking toward him, but
was talking in muffled tones to the driver. They
evidently had not heard the window let down, but
were ready for the first sign of an attempt on the
part of their victims to escape.</p>

<p>Quietly Gordon drew in his head speculating
rapidly on the possibility of wrenching that revolver
out of its owner’s hand. He could do it from where
he sat, but would it be wise? They were probably
locked in a trap, and the driver was very likely armed
also. What chance would he have to save Celia if
he brought on a desperate fight at this point? If he
were alone he might knock that revolver out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
man’s hand and spring from the window, taking his
chance of getting away, but now he had Celia to
think of and the case was different. Not for a universe
of governments could he leave a woman in
such desperate straits. She must be considered first
even ahead of the message. This was life and death.</p>

<p>He wondered at his own coolness as he sat back
in the carriage and quietly lifted the glass frame
back into place. Then he laid a steady hand on
Celia’s again and stooping close whispered into her
ear:</p>

<p>“I am afraid there’s something wrong with our
driver. Can you be a little brave,—dear?” He
did not know he had used the last word this time,
but it thrilled into the girl’s heart with a sudden
accession of trust.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she breathed close to his face. “You
don’t think he has been drinking, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps,” said Gordon relieved at the
explanation. “But keep calm. I think we can get
out of this all right. Suppose you change seats with
me and let me try if that door will open easily. We
might want to get out in a hurry in case he slows up
somewhere pretty soon.”</p>

<p>Celia quietly and swiftly slipped into Gordon’s
seat and he applied himself with all his strength and
ingenuity gently manipulating the latch and pressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
his shoulder against the door, until at last to his joy
it gave way reluctantly and he found that it would
swing open. He had worked carefully, else the
sudden giving of the latch would have thrown him
out of the carriage and given instant alarm to his
driver. He was so thoroughly convinced by this
time that he was being kidnapped, perhaps to be
murdered, that every sense was on the alert. It was
his characteristic to be exceedingly cool during a
crisis. It was the quality that the keen-eyed chief
had valued most in him, and the final reason why he
had been selected for this difficult task in place of
an older and more experienced man who at times
lost his head.</p>

<p>The door to the outside world being open Gordon
cautiously took a survey of the enemy from that
side. There was no gleaming weapon here. The
man set grimly enough, laying on the whip and muttering
curses to his bony horse who galloped recklessly
on as if partaking of the desperate desires of
his master. In the distance Gordon could hear the
rumbling of an oncoming train. The street was
still dark and scarcely a vehicle or person to be seen.
There seemed no help at hand, and no opportunity
to get out, for they were still rushing at a tremendous
pace. An attempt to jump now would very
likely result in broken limbs, which would only leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
them in a worse plight than they were. He slipped
back to his own seat and put Celia next to the free
door again. She must be where she could get out
first if the opportunity presented itself. Also, he
must manage to throw out the suit-cases if possible
on account of the letters and valuables they contained.</p>

<p>Instinctively his hand sought Celia’s in the darkness
again, and hers nestled into it in a frightened
way as if his strength gave her comfort.</p>

<p>Then, before they could speak or realize, there
came the rushing sound of a train almost upon them
and the cab came to a halt with a jerk, the driver
pulling the horse far back on his haunches to stop
him. The shock almost threw Celia to the floor,
but Gordon’s arm about her steadied her, and instantly
he was on the alert.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glancing</span> through the window he saw that they
were in front of a railroad track upon which a long
freight train was rushing madly along at a giddy
pace for a mere freight. The driver had evidently
hoped to pass this point before the train got there,
but had failed. The train had an exultant sound as
if it knew and had outwitted the driver.</p>

<p>On one side of the street were high buildings and
on the other a great lumber yard, between which
and their carriage there stood a team of horses
hitched to a covered wagon, from the back of which
some boards protruded, and this was on the side next
to Celia where the door would open! Gordon’s
heart leaped up with hope and wonder over the
miracle of their opportunity. The best thing about
their situation was that their driver had stopped
just a little back of the covered wagon, so that their
door would open to the street directly behind the
covered wagon. It made it possible for the carriage
door to swing wide and for them to slip across
behind the wagon without getting too near to the
driver. Nothing could have been better arranged
for their escape and the clatter of the empty freight
cars drowned all sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Without delay Gordon softly unlatched the door
and swung it open whispering to Celia:</p>

<p>“Go! Quick! Over there by the fence in the
shadow. Don’t look around nor speak! Quick!
I’ll come!”</p>

<p>Trembling in every limb yet with brave starry
eyes Celia slipped like a wraith from the carriage,
stole behind the boards and melted into the shadow
of the great fence of the lumber yard, her purple
plumes mere depths of shadow against the smoky
planks. Gordon, grasping the suit-cases, moved instantly
after her, deftly and silently closing the carriage
door and dropping into the shadows behind
the big wagon, scarcely able to believe as yet that
they had really escaped.</p>

<p>Ten feet back along the sidewalk was a gateway,
the posts being tall and thick. The gate itself was
closed but it hung a few inches inside the line of the
fence, and into this depression the two stepped softly
and stood, flattening themselves back against the
gate as closely as possible, scarcely daring to breathe,
while the long freight clattered and rambled its way
by like a lot of jolly washerwomen running and
laughing in a line and spatting their tired noisy feet
as they went; then the vehicles impatiently took up
their onward course. Gordon saw the driver look
down at the window below him and glance back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
hastily over his shoulder, and the man on the other
side of the box, looked down on his side. The glitter
of something in his hand shone for an instant in the
glare of the signal light over the track. Then the
horse lurched forward and the cab began its crazy
gait over the track and up the cobbled street. They
had started onward without getting down to look
in the carriage and see if all were safe with their
prisoners, and they had not even looked back to see
if they had escaped. They evidently trusted in the
means they had used to lock the carriage doors, and
had heard no sounds of their escaping. It was incredible,
but it was true. Gordon drew a long
breath of relief and relaxed from his strained position.
The next thing was to get out of that neighborhood
as swiftly as possible before those men
had time to discover that their birds had flown.
They would of course know at once where their
departure had taken place and come back swiftly
to search for them, with perhaps more men to help;
and a second time escape would be impossible.</p>

<p>Gordon snatched up the suit-cases with one hand,
and with the other drew Celia’s arm within his.</p>

<p>“Now, we must hurry with all our might,” he
said softly. “Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Her breath was coming in a sob, but her
eyes were shining bravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Poor child!” his voice was very tender.
“Were you much frightened?”</p>

<p>“A little,” she answered more bravely now.</p>

<p>“I shall have hard work to forgive myself for
all this,” he said tenderly. “But we mustn’t talk.
We have to get out of this quickly or they may come
back after us. Lean on me and walk as fast as you
can.”</p>

<p>Celia bent her efforts to take long springing
strides, and together they fairly skimmed the pavements,
turning first this corner, then that, in the
general direction from which Gordon thought they
had come, until at last, three blocks away they
caught the welcome whirr of a trolley, and breathless,
flew onward, just catching a car. They cared
not where it went so that they were safe in a bright
light with other people. No diamonds on any gentleman’s
neckscarf ever shone to Celia’s eyes with
so friendly a welcome as the dull brass buttons on
that trolley conductor’s coat as he rang up their
fares and answered Gordon’s questions about how
to get to East Liberty station; and their pleasant
homely gleam almost were her undoing, for now
that they were safe at last the tears would come to
her eyes.</p>

<p>Gordon watched her lovingly, tenderly, glad
that she did not know how terrible had been her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
danger. His heart was still beating wildly with the
thought of their marvellous escape, and his own
present responsibility. He must run no further
risks. They would keep to crowded trolleys, and
trust to hiding in the open. The main thing was to
get out of the city on the first train they could manage
to board.</p>

<p>When they reached East Liberty station a long
train was just coming in, all sleepers, and they
could hear the echo of a stentorian voice:</p>

<p>“Special for Harrisburg, Baltimore and Washington!
All aboard!” and up at the further end of
the platform Gordon saw the lank form of the detective
whom he had tried to avoid an hour before
at the other station.</p>

<p>Without taking time for thought he hurried
Celia forward and they sprang breathlessly aboard.
Not until they were fairly in the cars and the wheels
moving under them did it occur to him that his companion
had had nothing to eat since about twelve
o’clock. She must be famished, and in a fair way to
be ill again. What a fool he was not to have thought!
They could have stopped in some obscure restaurant
along the way as well as not, and taken a later train,
and yet it was safer to get away at once. Without
doubt there were watchers at East Liberty, too, and
he was lucky to have got on the train without a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
challenge. He was sure that detective’s face lighted
strangely as he looked his way. Perhaps there was a
buffet attached to the train. At least, he would investigate.
If there wasn’t, they must get off at the
next stop—there must be another stop surely somewhere
near the city—he could not remember, but
there surely must be.</p>

<p>They had to wait some time to get the attention
of the conductor. He was having much trouble with
some disgruntled passengers who each claimed to
have the same berth. Gordon finally got his ear,
and showing his stateroom tickets inquired if they
could be used on this train.</p>

<p>“No,” growled the worried conductor.
“You’re on the wrong train. This is a special, and
every berth in the train is taken now but one upper.”</p>

<p>“Then, we’ll have to get off at the next stop, I
suppose, and take the other train,” said Gordon dismally.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any other stop till somewhere in
the middle of the night. I tell you this is a special,
and we’re scheduled to go straight through. East
Liberty’s the last stop.”</p>

<p>“Then what shall we do?” asked Gordon inanely.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” snapped the conductor.
“I’ve enough to do without mending other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
people’s mistakes. Stay aboard, I suppose, unless
you want to jump off and commit suicide.”</p>

<p>“But I have a lady with me who isn’t at all
well,” said Gordon, with dignity.</p>

<p>“So much the worse for the lady,” replied the
conductor inhumanly. “There’s one upper berth,
I told you.”</p>

<p>“An upper berth wouldn’t do for her,” said
Gordon decidedly. “She isn’t well, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself!” snapped the harassed official.
“I reckon it’s better than nothing. You may not
have it long. I’m likely to be asked for it the next
half minute.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? And is there absolutely nothing
else?”</p>

<p>“Young man, I can’t waste words on you. I
haven’t time. Take it or let it alone. It’s all one to
me. There’s some standing room left in the day-coach,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it,” said Gordon meekly, wishing he
could go back and undo the last half-hour. How in
the world was he to go and tell Celia that he could
provide her nothing better than an upper berth?</p>

<p>She was sitting with her back to him, her face
resting wearily on her hand against the window.
Two men with largely checked suits, big seal rings,
and diamond scarf-pins sat in the opposite seat. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
knew it was most unpleasant for her. A nondescript
woman with a very large hat and thick powder on
her face shared Celia’s seat. He reflected that
“specials” did not always bear a select company.</p>

<p>“Is there nothing you can do?” he pleaded with
the conductor, as he took the bit of pasteboard entitling
him to the last vacant berth. “Don’t you
suppose you could get some man to change and give
her a lower berth? It’ll be very hard for her. She
isn’t used to upper berths.”</p>

<p>His eyes rested wistfully on the bowed head.
Celia had taken off her plumed hat, and the fitful
light of the car played with the gold of her hair.
The conductor’s grim eye softened as he looked.</p>

<p>“That the lady? I’ll see what I can do,” he said
briefly, and stumped off to the next car. The miracle
of her presence had worked its change upon him.</p>

<p>Gordon went over to Celia and told her in a low
tone that he hoped to have arrangements made for
her soon, so that she could be comfortable. She
must be fearfully tired with the excitement and
fright and hurry. He added that he had made a
great blunder in getting on this train, and now there
was no chance to get off for several hours, perhaps,
and probably no supper to be had.</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter in the least,” said Celia
wearily. “I’m not at all hungry.” She almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
smiled when she said it. He knew that what she
wanted was to have her mind relieved about the
letters. But she readily saw that there was no opportunity
now.</p>

<p>She even seemed sorry at his troubled look, and
tried to smile again through the settled sadness in
her eyes. He could see she was very weary, and he
felt like a great brute in care of a child, and mentally
berated himself for his own thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>Gordon started off to search for something to
eat for her, and was more successful than he had
dared hope. The newsboy had two chicken sandwiches
left, and these, with the addition of a fine
orange, a box of chocolates, and a glass of ice-water,
he presently brought to her, and was rewarded by a
smile this time, almost as warm and intimate as those
she had given him during their beautiful day.</p>

<p>But he could not sit beside her, for the places
were all taken, and he could not stand in the aisle
and talk, for the porter was constantly running back
and forth making up the berths. There seemed to
be a congested state of things in the whole train,
every seat being full and men standing in the aisles.
He noticed now that they all wore badges of some
fraternal order. It was doubtless a delegation to
some great convention, upon which they had intruded.
They were a good-natured, noisy, happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
crowd, but not anywhere among them was to be
found a quiet spot where he and Celia could go on
with their suddenly interrupted conversation. Presently
the conductor came to him and said he had
found a gentleman who would give the lady his
lower berth and take her upper one. It was already
made up, and the lady might take possession at once.</p>

<p>Gordon made the exchange of tickets, and immediately
escorted Celia to it. He found her most glad
to go for she was now unutterably weary, and was
longing to get away from the light and noise about
her.</p>

<p>He led the way with the suit-cases, hoping that
in the other car there would be some spot where
they could talk for a few minutes. But he was disappointed.
It was even fuller than in the first car.
He arranged everything for her comfort as far as
possible, disposed of her hat and fixed her suit-case
so that she could open it, but even while he was doing
it there were people crowding by, and no private
conversation could be had. He stepped back when
all was arranged and held the curtain aside that she
might sit on the edge of her berth. Then stooping
over he whispered:</p>

<p>“Try to trust me until morning. I’ll explain it
all to you then, so that you will understand how I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
have had nothing to do with those letters. Forget
it, and try to rest. Will you?”</p>

<p>His tone was wistful. He had never wanted to
do anything so much in all his life as to stoop and
kiss those sweet lips, and the lovely eyes that looked
up at him out of the dusky shadows of the berth,
filled with fear and longing. They looked more
than ever like the blue tired flowers that drooped
from her gown wearily. But he held himself with
a firm hand. She was not his to kiss. When she
knew how he had deceived her, she would probably
never give him the right to kiss her.</p>

<p>“I will try,” she murmured in answer to his
question, and then added: “But where will you
be? Is your berth nearby?”</p>

<p>“Not far away—that is, I had to take a place in
another car, they are so crowded.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said a little anxiously. “Are you
sure you have a good comfortable place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I shall be all right,” he answered joyously.
It was so wonderful to have her care whether
he was comfortable or not.</p>

<p>The porter was making up the opposite berth,
and there was no room to stand longer, so he bade
her good night, she putting out her hand for a farewell.
For an instant he held it close, with gentle
pressure, as if to reassure her, then he went away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
to the day-coach, and settled down into a hard
corner at the very back of the car, drawing his travelling
cap over his eyes, and letting his heart beat
out wild joy over that little touch of her dear hand.
Wave after wave of sweetness went over him, thrilling
his very soul with a joy he had never known
before.</p>

<p>And this was love! And what kind of a wretch
was he, presuming to love like this a woman who
was the promised bride of another man! Ah, but
such a man! A villain! A brute, who had used his
power over her to make her suffer tortures! Had
a man like that a right to claim her? His whole
being answered “no.”</p>

<p>Then the memory of the look in her eyes, the
turn of her head, the soft touch of her fingers as
they lay for that instant in his, the inflection of
her voice, would send that wave of sweetness over
his senses, his heart would thrill anew, and he would
forget the wretch who stood between him and this
lovely girl whom he knew now he loved as he had
never dreamed a man could love.</p>

<p>Gradually his mind steadied itself under the
sweet intoxication, and he began to wonder just
what he should say to her in the morning. It was
a good thing he had not had further opportunity to
talk with her that night, for he could not have told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
her everything; and now if all went well they would
be in Washington in the morning, and he might
make some excuse till after he had delivered his
message. Then he would be free to tell the whole
story, and lay his case before her for decision. His
heart throbbed with ecstasy as he thought of the
possibility of her forgiving him, and yet it seemed
most unlikely. Sometimes he would let his wild
longings fancy for just an instant what joy it would
be if she could be induced to let the marriage stand.
But he told himself at the same time that that could
never be. It was very likely that there was some one
else in New York to whom her heart would
turn if she were free from the scoundrel who had
threatened her into a compulsory marriage. He
would promise to help her, protect her, defend her
from the man who was evidently using blackmail
to get her into his power for some purpose; most
likely for the sake of having control of her property.
At least it would be some comfort to be able to help
her out of her trouble. And yet, would she ever trust
a man who had even unwittingly allowed her to be
bound by the sacred tie of marriage to an utter
stranger?</p>

<p>And thus, amid hope and fear, the night whirled
itself away. Forward in the sleeper the girl lay wide
awake for a long time. In the middle of the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
a thought suddenly evolved itself out of the blackness
of her curtained couch. She sat upright alertly
and stared into the darkness, as if it were a thing
that she could catch and handle and examine. The
thought was born out of a dreamy vision of the crisp
brown waves, almost curls if they had not been so
short and thick, that covered the head of the man
who had lain sleeping outside her curtains in the
early morning. It came to her with sudden force
that not so had been the hair of the boy George
Hayne, who used to trouble her girlish days. His
was thin and black and oily, collecting naturally into
little isolated strings with the least warmth, and
giving him the appearance of a kitten who had been
out in the rain. One lock, how well she remembered
that lock!—one lock on the very crown of his head
had always refused to lie down, no matter how
much persuasion was brought to bear upon it. It
had been the one point on which the self-satisfied
George had been pregnable, his hair, that scalp lock
that would always arise stiffly, oilily, from the top
of his head. The hair she had looked at admiringly
that morning in the dawning crimson of the rising
sun had not been that way. It had curved clingingly
to the shape of the fine head as if it loved to
go that way. It was beautiful and fine and burnished
with a sense of life and vigor in its every wave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Could hair change in ten years? Could it grow
brown where it had been black? Could it become
glossy instead of dull and oily? Could it take on the
signs of natural wave where it had been as straight
as a die? Could it grow like fur where it had been
so thin?</p>

<p>The girl could not solve the problem, but the
thought was most startling and brought with it many
suggestive possibilities that were most disturbing.
Yet gradually out of the darkness she drew a sort
of comfort in her dawning enlightenment. Two
things she had to go on in her strange premises, he
had said he did not write the letters, and his hair
was not the same. Who then was he? Her husband
now undoubtedly, but who? And if deeds and
hair could change so materially, why not spirits? At
least he was not the same as she had feared and
dreaded. There was so much comfort.</p>

<p>And at last she lay down and slept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were late coming into Washington, for the
Special had been sidetracked in the night for several
express trains, and the noisy crowd who had kept
one another awake till after midnight made up by
sleeping far into the morning.</p>

<p>Three times did Gordon make the journey three
cars front to see if his companion of yesterday were
awake and needed anything, but each time found
the curtains drawn and still, and each time he went
slowly back again to his seat in the crowded day-coach.</p>

<p>It was not until the white dome of the capitol,
and the tall needle of the monument, were painted
soft and vision-like against the sky, reminding one
of the pictures of the heavenly city in the story of
Pilgrim’s Progress, and faintly suggesting a new
and visionary world, that he sought her again, and
found her fully ready, standing in the aisle while
the porter put up the berth out of the way. Beneath
the great brim of her purple hat, where the soft
fronds of her plumes trembled with the motion of
the train, she lifted sweet eyes to him, as if she were
both glad and frightened to see him. And then that
ecstasy shot through him again, as he realized suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
what it would be to have her for his life-companion,
to feel her looks of gladness were all for
him, and have the right to take all fright away from
her.</p>

<p>They could only smile at each other for good-morning,
for everybody was standing up and being
brushed, and pushing here and there for suit-cases
and lost umbrellas; and everybody talked loudly,
and laughed a great deal, and told how late the train
was. Then at last they were there, and could get
out and walk silently side by side in the noisy procession
through the station to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>What little things sometimes change a lifetime,
and make for our safety or our destruction! That
very morning three keen watchers were set to guard
that station at Washington to hunt out the government
spy who had stolen back the stolen message,
and take him, message and all, dead or alive, back
to New York; for the man who could testify against
the Holman Combination was not to be let live if
there was such a thing as getting him out of the
way. But they never thought to watch the Special
which was supposed to carry only delegates to the
great convention. He could not possibly be on that!
They knew he was coming from Pittsburgh, for
they had been so advised by telegram the evening
before by one of their company who had seen him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
buying a sleeper ticket for Washington, but they felt
safe about that Special, for they had made inquiries
and been told no one but delegates could possibly
come on it. They had done their work thoroughly,
and were on hand with every possible plan perfected
for bagging their game, but they took the time
when the Pittsburgh Special was expected to arrive
for eating a hearty breakfast in the restaurant across
the street from the station. Two of them emerged
from the restaurant doorway in plenty of time to
meet the next Pittsburgh train, just as Gordon, having
placed the lady in a closed carriage, was getting
in himself.</p>

<p>If the carriage had stood in any other spot along
the pavement in front of the station, they never
would have seen him, but, as it was, they had a full
view of him; and because they were Washington
men, and experts in their line, they recognized him
at once, and knew their plans had failed, and that
only by extreme measures could they hope to prevent
the delivery of the message which would mean
downfall and disaster to them and their schemes.</p>

<p>As Gordon slammed shut the door of the carriage,
he caught a vision of his two enemies pointing
excitedly toward him, and he knew that the
bloodhounds were on the scent.</p>

<p>His heart beat wildly. His anxiety was divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
between the message and the lady. What should he
do? Drive at once to the home of his chief and deliver
the message, or leave the girl at his rooms,
’phone for a faster conveyance and trust to getting
to his chief ahead of his pursuers?</p>

<p>“Don’t let anything hinder you! Don’t let anything
hinder you! Make it a matter of life and
death!” rang the little ditty in his ears, and now it
seemed as if he must go straight ahead with the
message. And yet—“a matter of life and death!”
He could not, must not, might not, take the lady
with him into danger. If he must be in danger of
death he did not want to die having exposed an innocent
stranger to the same.</p>

<p>Then there was another point to be thought of.</p>

<p>He had already told the driver to take him to his
apartments, and to drive as rapidly as possible. It
would not do to stop him now and change the directions,
for a pistol-shot could easily reach him yet;
and, coming from a crowd, who would be suspected?
His enemies were standing on the threshold of a
place where there were many of their kind to protect
them, and none of his friends knew of his coming.
It would be a race for life from now on to
the finish.</p>

<p>Celia was looking out with interest at the streets,
recognizing landmarks with wonder, and did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
notice Gordon’s white, set face and burning eyes as
he strained his vision to note how fast the horse
was going. Oh, if the driver would only turn off
at the next corner into the side street they could
not watch the carriage so far, but it was not likely,
for this was the most direct road, and yet—yes, he
had turned! Joy! The street here was so crowded
that he had sought the narrower, less crowded way
that he might go the faster.</p>

<p>It seemed an age to him before they stopped at
his apartments. To Celia, it had been but a short
ride, in which familiar scenes had brought her
pleasure, for she recognized that she was not in
strange Chicago, but in Washington, a city often
visited. Somehow she felt it was an omen of a
better future than she had feared.</p>

<p>“Oh, why didn’t you tell me?” she smiled to
Gordon. “It is Washington, dear old Washington.”</p>

<p>Somehow he controlled the tumult in his heart
and smiled back, saying in a voice quite natural:</p>

<p>“I am so glad you like it.”</p>

<p>She seemed to understand that they could not
talk until they reached a quiet place somewhere, and
she did not trouble him with questions. Instead—she
looked from the window, or watched him furtively,
comparing him with her memory of George
Hayne, and wondering in her own thoughts. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
glad to have them to herself for just this little bit,
for now that the morning had come she was almost
afraid of revelation, what it might bring forth.
And so it came about that they took the swift ride in
more or less silence, and neither thought it strange.</p>

<p>As the carriage stopped, he spoke with low, hurried
voice, tense with excitement, but her own nerves
were on a strain also, and she did not notice.</p>

<p>“We get out here.”</p>

<p>He had the fare ready for the driver, and, stepping
out, hurried Celia into the shelter of the hallway.
It happened that an elevator had just come
down, so it was but a second more before they were
up safe in the hall before his own apartment.</p>

<p>Taking a latch-key from his pocket, he applied
it to the door, flung it open, and ushered Celia to a
large leather chair in the middle of the room. Then,
stepping quickly to the side of the room, he touched
a bell, and from it went to the telephone, with an
“Excuse me, please, this is necessary,” to the girl,
who sat astonished, wondering at the homelikeness
of the room and at the “at-homeness” of the man.
She had expected to be taken to a hotel. This
seemed to be a private apartment with which he was
perfectly acquainted. Perhaps it belonged to some
friend. But how, after an absence of years, could
he remember just where to go, which door and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
elevator to take, and how to fit the key with so accustomed
a hand? Then her attention was arrested by
his voice:</p>

<p>“Give me 254 L please,” he said.... “Is
this 254 L?... Is Mr. Osborne in?... You
say he has <i>not</i> gone to the office yet?...
May I speak with him?... Is this Mr. Osborne?...
I did not expect you to know my
voice.... Yes, sir; just arrived, and all safe
so far. Shall I bring it to the house or the office?...
The house?... All right, sir. Immediately....
By the way, I am sure Hale
and Burke are on my track. They saw me at the
station.... To your house?... You
will wait until I come?... All right, sir.
Yes, immediately.... Sure, I’ll take precaution....
Good-by.”</p>

<p>With the closing words came a tap at the door.</p>

<p>“Come, Henry,” he answered, as the astonished
girl turned toward the door. “Henry, you will go
down, please, to the restaurant, and bring up a menu
card. This lady will select what she would like to
have, and you will serve breakfast for her in this
room as soon as possible. I shall be out for perhaps
an hour, and, meantime, you will obey any orders
she may give you.”</p>

<p>He did not introduce her as his wife, but she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
did not notice the omission. She had suddenly become
aware of a strange, distraught haste in his
manner, and when he said he was going out alarm
seized her, she could not tell why.</p>

<p>The man bowed deferentially to his master,
looked his admiration and devotion to the lady,
waited long enough to say:</p>

<p>“I’se mighty glad to see you safe back, sah—”
and disappeared to obey orders.</p>

<p>Celia turned toward Gordon for an explanation,
but he was already at the telephone again:</p>

<p>“46!... Is this the Garage?...
This is The Harris Apartments.... Can you
send Thomas with a closed car to the rear door immediately?...
Yes.... No, I want
Thomas, and a car that can speed.... Yes,
the rear door, <i>rear</i>, and at once.... What?...
What’s that?... But I <i>must</i>....
It’s <i>official</i> business.... Well, I thought so.
Hurry them up. Good-by.”</p>

<p>He turned and saw her troubled gaze following
him with growing fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” she asked anxiously.
“Has something happened?”</p>

<p>Just one moment he paused, and, coming toward
her, laid his hands on hers tenderly.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter at all,” he said soothingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
“At least nothing that need worry you. It is just
a matter of pressing business. I’m sorry to have
to go from you for a little while, but it is necessary.
I cannot explain to you until I return. You will
trust me? You will not worry?”</p>

<p>“I will try!”</p>

<p>Her lips were quivering, and her eyes were filled
with tears. Again he felt that intense longing to
lay his lips upon hers and comfort her, but he put it
from him.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to feel sad about,” he said,
smiling gently. “It is nothing tragic only there is
need for haste, for if I wait, I may fail yet—— It
is something that means a great deal to me. When
I come back I will explain all.”</p>

<p>“Go!” she said, putting out her hands in a
gesture of resignation, as if she would hurry him
from her. And though she was burning to know
what it all meant there was that about him that compelled
her to trust him and to wait.</p>

<p>Then his control almost went from him. He
nearly took those hands in his and kissed them, but
he did not. Instead, he went with swift steps to
his bedroom door, threw open a chiffonier drawer,
and took therefrom something small and sinister.
She could see the gleam of its polished metal, and
she sensed a strange little menace in the click as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
did something to it, she could not see what, because
his back was to her. He came out with his hand in
his pocket, as if he had just hidden something there.</p>

<p>She was not familiar with firearms. Her mother
had been afraid of them and her brother had never
flourished any around the house, yet she knew by
instinct that some weapon of defence was in Gordon’s
possession; and a nameless horror rose in her heart
and shone from her blue eyes, but she would not
speak a word to let him know it. If he had not been
in such haste, he would have seen. Her horror
would have been still greater if she had known that
he already carried one loaded revolver and was
taking a second in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” he called as he hurried out the
door. “Henry will get anything you need, and I
shall soon be back.”</p>

<p>The door closed and he was gone. She heard
his quick step down the hall, heard the elevator door
slide and slam again, and then she knew he was gone
down. Outside an automobile sounded and she
seemed to hear again his words at the phone, “The
rear door.” Why had he gone to the rear door?
Was he in hiding? Was he flying from some one?
What, oh what, did it mean?</p>

<p>Without stopping to reason it out, she flew
across the room and opened the door of the bedroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
he had just left, then through it passed swiftly to a
bath-room beyond. Yes, there was a window.
Would it be the one? Could she see him? And
what good would it do her if she could?</p>

<p>She crowded close to the window. There was a
heavy sash with stained glass, but she selected a
clear bit of yellow and put her eye close. Yes, there
was a closed automobile just below her, and it had
started away from the building. He had gone, then.
Where?</p>

<p>Her mind was a blank for a few minutes. She
went slowly, mechanically back to the other room
without noticing anything about her, sat down in
the chair, putting her hands to her temples, and
tried to think. Back to the moment in the church
where he had appeared at her side and the service
had begun. Something had told her then that he
was different, and yet there had been those letters,
and how could it possibly be that he had not written
them? He was gone on some dangerous business.
Of that she felt sure. There had been some caution
given him by the man to whom he first ’phoned. He
had promised to take precaution—that meant the
little, wicked, gleaming thing in his pocket. Perhaps
some harm would come to him, and she would
never know. And then she stared at the opposite
wall with wonder-filled eyes. Well, and suppose it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
did? Why did she care? Was he not the man
whose power over her but two short days ago would
have made her welcome death as her deliverer?
Why was all changed now? Just because he had
smiled upon her and been kind? Had given her a
few wild flowers and said her eyes were like them?
Had hair that waved instead of being straight and
thin? And where was all her loyalty to her dear
dead father’s memory? How could she mind that
danger should come to one who had threatened to
tell terrible lies that should blacken him in the
thoughts of people who had loved him? Had she
forgotten the letters? Was she willing to forgive
all just because he had declared that he did not write
them? How foolish! He said he could prove that
he did not, but of course that was all nonsense. He
must have written them. And yet there was the
wave in his hair, and the kindness in his eyes. And
he had looked—oh, he had looked terrible things
when he had read that letter; as if he would like to
wreak vengeance on the man who had written it.
Could a man masquerade that way?</p>

<p>And then a new solution to the problem came to
her. Suppose this—whoever he was—this man who
had married her, had gone out to find and punish
George Hayne? Suppose—— But then she covered
her eyes with her hands and shuddered. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
why should she care? But she did. Suppose he
should be killed, himself! Who was he if not George
Hayne and how did he come to take his place? Was
it just another of George’s terrible tricks upon her?</p>

<p>A quick vision came of their bringing him back
to her. He would lie, perhaps, on that great crimson
leather couch over there, just as he had lain in
the dawning of the morning in the stateroom of the
train, with his hands hanging limp, and one perhaps
across his breast, as if he were guarding something,
and his bright waves of brown hair lying heavy
about his forehead—only, his forehead would be
white, so white and cold, with a little blue mark in
his temple perhaps.</p>

<p>The footsteps of the man Henry brought her
back to the present again. She smiled at him pleasantly
as he entered, and answered his questions
about what she would have for breakfast; but it was
he who selected the menu, not she, and after he had
gone she could not have told what she had ordered.
She could not get away from the vision on the
couch. She closed her eyes and pressed her cold
fingers against her eyeballs to drive it away, but still
her bridegroom seemed to lie there before her.</p>

<p>The colored man came back presently with a
loaded tray, and set it down on a little table which
he wheeled before her, as though he had done it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
many times before. She thanked him, and said there
was nothing else she needed, so he went away.</p>

<p>She toyed with the cup of delicious coffee which
he had poured for her, and the few swallows she
took gave her new heart. She broke a bit from a
hot roll, and ate a little of the delicious steak, but
still her mind was at work at the problem, and her
heart was full of nameless anxiety.</p>

<p>He had gone away without any breakfast himself,
and he had had no supper the night before, she
was sure. He probably had given to her everything
he could get on the train. She was haunted with
regret because she had not shared with him. She
got up and walked about the room, trying to shake
off the horror that was upon her, and the dread of
what the morning might bring forth. Ordinarily
she would have thought of sending a message to
her mother and brother, but her mind was so
troubled now that it never occurred to her.</p>

<p>The walls of the room were tinted a soft greenish
gray, and above the picture moulding they blended
into a woodsy landscape with a hint of water, greensward,
and blue sky through interlacing branches.
It reminded her of the little village they had seen as
they started from the train in the early morning
light. What a beautiful day they had spent together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
and how it had changed her whole attitude of heart
toward the man she had married!</p>

<p>Two or three fine pictures were hung in good
lights. She studied them, and knew that the one
who had selected and hung them was a judge of true
art; but they did not hold her attention long, for as
yet, she had not connected the room with the man
for whom she waited.</p>

<p>A handsome mahogany desk stood open in a
broad space by the window. She was attracted by
a little painted miniature of a woman. She took it
up and studied the face. It was fine and sweet, with
brown hair dressed low, and eyes that reminded her
of the man who had just gone from her. Was this,
then, the home of some relative with whom he had
come to stop for a day or two, and, if so, where was
the relative? The dress in the miniature was of a
quarter of a century past, yet the face was young and
sweet, as young, perhaps, as herself. She wondered
who it was. She put the miniature back in place
with caressing hand. She felt that she would like to
know this woman with the tender eyes. She wished
her here now, that she might tell her all her anxiety.</p>

<p>Her eye wandered to the pile of letters, some of
them official-looking ones, one or two in square, perfumed
envelopes, with high, angular writing. They
were all addressed to Mr. Cyril Gordon. That was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
strange! Who was Mr. Cyril Gordon? What had
they—what had she—to do with him? Was he a
friend whom George—whom they—were visiting
for a few days? It was all bewildering.</p>

<p>Then the telephone rang.</p>

<p>Her heart beat wildly and she looked toward it
as if it had been a human voice speaking and she
had no power to answer. What should she do now?
Should she answer? Or should she wait for the
man to come? Could the man hear the telephone
bell or was she perhaps expected to answer? And
yet if Mr. Cyril Gordon—well, somebody ought to
answer. The ’phone rang insistently once more,
and still a third time. What if <i>he</i> should be calling
her! Perhaps he was in distress. This thought sent
her flying to the ’phone. She took down the receiver
and called:</p>

<p>“Hello!” and her voice sounded far away to
herself.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Gordon’s apartment?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, for her eyes were resting
on the pile of letters close at hand.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Gordon there?”</p>

<p>“No, he is not,” she answered, growing more
confident now and almost wishing she had not presumed
to answer a stranger’s ’phone.</p>

<p>“Why, I just ’phoned to the office and they told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
me he had returned,” said a voice that had an imperious
note in it. “Are you sure he isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Who is this, please?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Celia trying to make
time and knowing not how to reply. She was not
any longer Miss Hathaway. Who was she? Mrs.
Hayne? She shrank from the name. It was filled
with horror for her. “Who is this, I said,” snapped
the other voice now. “Is this the chambermaid?
Because if it is I’d like you to look around and
inquire and be quite sure that Mr. Gordon isn’t
there. I wish to speak with him about something
very important.”</p>

<p>Celia smiled.</p>

<p>“No, this is not the chambermaid,” she said
sweetly, “and I am quite sure Mr. Gordon is not
here.”</p>

<p>“How long before he will be there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know really, for I have but just come
myself.”</p>

<p>“Who is this to whom I am talking?”</p>

<p>“Why—just a friend,” she answered, wondering
if that were the best thing to say.</p>

<p>“Oh!” there was a long and contemplative pause
at the other end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Well, could you give Mr. Gordon a message
when he comes in?”</p>

<p>“Why certainly, I think so. Who is this?”</p>

<p>“Miss Bentley. Julia Bentley. He’ll know,”
replied the imperious one eagerly now. “And tell
him please that he is expected here to dinner to-night.
We need him to complete the number, and
he simply mustn’t fail me. I’ll excuse him for going
off in such a rush if he comes early and tells me all
about it. Now you won’t forget, will you? You
got the name, Bentley, did you? B, E, N, T, L, E, Y,
you know. And you’ll tell him the minute he comes
in?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! What did you say your name
was?”</p>

<p>But Celia had hung up. Somehow the message
annoyed her, she could not tell why. She wished
she had not answered the ’phone. Whoever Mr.
Cyril Gordon was what should she do if he should
suddenly appear? And as for this imperious lady
and her message she hoped she would never have to
deliver it. On second thought why not write it and
leave it on his desk with the pile of letters? She
would do it. It would serve to pass away a few of
these dreadful minutes that lagged so distressfully.</p>

<p>She sat down and wrote: “Miss Bentley wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Mr. Gordon to dine with her this evening. She
will pardon his running away the other day if he
will come early.” She laid it beside the high angular
writing on the square perfumed letters and went
back to the leather chair too restless to rest yet too
weary to stand up.</p>

<p>She went presently to the back windows to look
out, and then to the side ones. Across the housetops
she could catch a glimpse of domes and buildings.
There was the Congressional Library, which
usually delighted her with its exquisite tones of gold
and brown and white. But she had no eyes for it
now. Beyond were more buildings, all set in the
lovely foliage which was much farther developed
than it had been in New York State. From another
window she could get a glimpse of the Potomac
shining in the morning sun.</p>

<p>She wandered to the front windows and looked
out. There were people passing and repassing. It
was a busy street, but she could not make out
whether it was one she knew or not. There were
two men walking back and forth on the opposite
side. They did not go further than the corner of the
street either way. They looked across at the windows
sometimes and pointed up, when they met,
and once one of them took something out of his
pocket and flashed it under his coat at his side, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
to have it ready for use. It reminded her of the
thing her husband had held in his hand in the bedroom
and she shuddered. She watched them, fascinated,
not able to draw herself away from the
window.</p>

<p>Now and then she would go to the rear window,
to see if there was any sign of the automobile returning,
and then hurry back to the front, to see if
the men were still there. Once she returned to the
chair, and, lying back, shut her eyes, and let the
memory of yesterday sweep over her in all its sweet
details, up to the time when they had got into the
way train and she had seemed to feel her disloyalty
to her father. But now her heart was all on the
other side, and she began to feel that there had been
some dreadful mistake, somewhere, and he was
surely all right. He could not, could not have written
those terrible letters. Then again the details of
their wild carriage ride in Pittsburgh and miraculous
escape haunted her. There was something
strange and unexplained about that which she must
understand.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span>, Gordon was speeding away to another
part of the city by the fastest time an experienced
chauffeur dared to make. About the time they
turned the first corner into the avenue, two burly
policemen sauntered casually into the pretty square
in front of the house where lived the chief of the
Secret Service. There was nothing about their demeanor
to show that they had been detailed there by
special urgency, and three men who hurried to the
little park just across the street from the house
could not possibly know that their leisurely and
careless stroll was the result of a hurried telephone
message from the chief to police headquarters immediately
after his message from Gordon.</p>

<p>The policemen strolled by the house, greeted each
other, and walked on around the square across the
little park. They eyed the three men sitting idly on a
bench, and passed leisurely on. They disappeared
around a corner, and to the three men were out of
the way. The latter did not know the hidden places
where the officers took up their watch, and when an
automobile appeared, and the three stealthily got up
from their park bench and distributed themselves
among the shrubbery near the walk, they knew not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
that their every movement was observed with keen
attention. But they did wonder how it happened
that those two policemen seemed to spring out of the
ground suddenly, just as the auto came to a halt in
front of the chief’s house.</p>

<p>Gordon sprang out and up the steps with a
bound, the door opening before him as if he were
expected. The two grim and apparently indifferent
policemen stood outside like two stone images on
guard, while up the street with rhythmic sound rode
two mounted police, also coming to a halt before the
house as if for a purpose. The three men in the
bushes hid their instruments of death, and would
have slunk away had there been a chance; but, turning
to make a hasty flight, they were met by three
more policemen. There was the crack of a revolver
as one of the three desperadoes tried a last reckless
dash for freedom—and failed. The wretch went to
justice with his right arm hanging limp by his side.</p>

<p>Inside the house Gordon was delivering up his
message, and as he laid it before his chief, and stood
silent while the elder man read and pondered its
tremendous import, it occurred to him for the first
time that his chief would require some report of his
journey, and the hindrances that had made him a
whole day late in getting back to Washington. His
heart stood still with sudden panic. What was he to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
do? How could he tell it all? What right had he to
tell of his marriage to an unknown woman? A
marriage that perhaps was not a marriage. He
could not know what the outcome would be until he
had told the girl everything. As far as he himself
was concerned he knew that the great joy of his life
had come to him in her. Yet he could not hope that
it would be so with her. And he must think of her
and protect her good name in every way. If there
should be such a thing ever as that she should consent
to remain with him and be his wife he must
never let a soul know but what the marriage had been
planned long ago. It would not be fair to her. It
would make life intolerable for them both either
together or apart. And while he might be and doubtless
was perfectly safe in confiding in his chief, and
asking him to keep silence about the matter, still he
felt that even that would be a breach of faith with
Celia. He must close his lips upon the story until
he could talk with her and know her wishes. He
drew a sigh of weariness. It was a long, hard way
he had come, and it was not over. The worst ordeal
would be his confession to the bride who was not his
wife.</p>

<p>The chief looked up.</p>

<p>“Could you make this out, Gordon?” he asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
noting keenly the young man’s weary eyes, the
strained, tense look about his mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes sir; I saw it at once. I was almost
afraid my eyes might betray the secret before I got
away with it.”</p>

<p>“Then you know what you have saved the country,
and what you have been worth to the Service.”</p>

<p>The young man flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said, looking down. “I
understood it was important, and I am glad I was
able to accomplish the errand without failing.”</p>

<p>“Have you reason to suppose you were followed,
except for what you saw at the station in this city?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I am sure there were detectives after
me as I was leaving New York. They were suspicious
of me. I saw one of the men who had been
at the dinner with me watching me. The disguise—and—some
circumstances—threw him off. He
wasn’t sure. Then, there was a man—you know
him, Balder—at Pittsburgh?——”</p>

<p>“Pittsburgh!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you wonder how I got to Pittsburgh.
You see, I was shadowed almost from the first I
suspect, for when I reached the station in New York
I was sure I recognized this man who had sat opposite
me a few minutes before. I suppose my disguise,
which you so thoughtfully provided, bothered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
him, for though he followed me about at a little distance
he didn’t speak to me. I had to get on the
first train that circumstances permitted, and perhaps
the fact that it was a Chicago train made him think
he was mistaken in me. Anyhow I saw no more of
him after the train left the station. Rather unexpectedly
I found I could get the drawing-room compartment,
and went into immediate retirement, leaving
the train at daylight where it was delayed on a
side track, and walked across country till I found a
conveyance that took me to a Pittsburgh train. It
didn’t seem feasible to get away from the Chicago
train any sooner as the train made no further stops,
and it was rather late at night by the time I boarded
it. I thought I would run less risk by making a détour.
I never dreamed they would have watchers
out for me at Pittsburgh, and I can’t think yet how
they managed to get on my track, but almost the
first minute I landed I spied Balder stretching his
neck over the crowds. I bolted from the station at
once and finding a carriage drawn up before the door
just ready for me I got in and ordered them to drive
me to East Liberty station.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I shall always be suspicious of
handy closed carriages after this experience. I certainly
have reason to be. The door was no sooner
closed on me than the driver began to race like mad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
through the streets. I didn’t think much of it at
first until he had been going some time, fully long
enough to have reached East Liberty, and the horse
was still rushing like a locomotive. Then I saw that
we were in a lonely district of the city that seemed
unfamiliar. That alarmed me and I tapped on the
window and called to the driver. He paid no attention.
Then I found the doors were fastened shut,
and the windows plugged so they wouldn’t open.</p>

<p>“I discovered that an armed man rode beside
the driver. I managed to get one of the doors open
after a good deal of work, and escaped when we
stopped for a freight train to pass; but I’m satisfied
that I was being kidnapped and if I hadn’t got away
just when I did you would never have heard of me
again or the message either. I finally managed to
reach East Liberty station and jumped on the first
train that came in, but I caught a glimpse of Balder
stretching his neck over the crowd. He must have
seen me and had Hale and Burke on the watch when
I got here. They just missed me by a half second.
They went over to the restaurant—didn’t expect me
on a special, but I escaped them, and I’m mighty
glad to get that little paper into your possession and
out of mine. It’s rather a long story to tell the
whole, but I think you have the main facts.”</p>

<p>There was a suspicious glitter in the keen eyes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the kind old chief as he put out his hand and grasped
Gordon’s in a hearty shake; but all he said was:</p>

<p>“And you are all worn out—I’ll guarantee you
didn’t sleep much last night.”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” said Gordon; “I had to sit up in a
day-coach and share the seat with another man.
Besides, I was somewhat excited.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course!” puffed the old chief,
coughing vigorously, and showing by his gruff attitude
that he was deeply affected. “Well, young
man, this won’t be forgotten by the Department.
Now you go home and take a good sleep. Take the
whole day off if you wish, and then come down to-morrow
morning and tell me all about it. Isn’t there
anything more I need to know at once that justice
may be done?”</p>

<p>“I believe not,” said Gordon, with a sigh of relief.
“There’s a list of the men who were at the
dinner with me. I wrote them down from memory
last night when I couldn’t sleep. I also wrote a few
scraps of conversation, which will show you just
how deep the plot had gone. If I had not read the
message and known its import, I should not have
understood what they were talking about.”</p>

<p>“H-m! Yes. If there had been more time before
you started I might have told you all about it.
Still, it seemed desirable that you should appear as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
much at your ease as possible. I thought this would
be best accomplished by your knowing nothing of
the import of the writing when you first met the
people.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was as well that I did not know
any more than I did. You are a great chief, sir! I
was deeply impressed anew with that fact as I saw
how wonderfully you had planned for every possible
emergency. It was simply great, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Pooh! Get you home and to bed,”
said the old chief quite brusquely.</p>

<p>He touched a bell and a man appeared.</p>

<p>“Jessup, is the coast clear?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yessah,” declared the darky. “Dey have jest
hed a couple o’ shots in de pahk, an’ now dey tuk
de villains off to der p’lice station. De officers is
out der waitin’ to ’scort de gemman.”</p>

<p>“Get home with you, Gordon, and don’t come
to the office till ten in the morning. Then come
straight to my private room.”</p>

<p>Gordon thanked him, and left the room preceded
by the gray-haired servant. He was surprised to
find the policemen outside, and wondered still more
that they seemed to be going one in front and the
other behind him as he rode along. He was greatly
relieved that he had not been called upon to give the
whole story. His heart was filled with anxiety now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to get back to the girl, and tell her everything, and
yet he dreaded it more than anything he had ever had
to face in all his life. He sat back on the cushions,
and, covering his face with his hands, tried to think
how he should begin, but he could see nothing but her
sweet eyes filled with tears, think of nothing but the
way she had looked and smiled during the beautiful
morning they had spent together in the little town
of Milton. Beautiful little Milton. Should he ever
see it again?</p>

<p>Celia at her window grew more and more nervous
as an hour and then another half-hour slipped
slowly away, and still he did not come. Then two
mounted policemen rode rapidly down the street
following an automobile, in which sat the man for
whom she waited.</p>

<p>She had no eyes now for the men who had been
lurking across the way, and when she thought to
look for them again she saw them running in the
opposite direction as fast as they could go, making
wild gestures for a car to stop for them.</p>

<p>She stood by the window and saw Gordon get
out of the car, and disappear into the building below,
saw the car wheel and curve away and the
mounted police take up their stand on either corner;
heard the clang of the elevator as it started up, and
the clash of its door as it stopped at that floor; heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
steps coming on toward the door, and the key in the
latch. Then she turned and looked at him, her two
hands clasped before her, and her two eyes yearning,
glad and fearful all at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have been so frightened about you! I
am so glad you have come!” she said, and caught
her voice in a sob as she took one little step toward
him.</p>

<p>He threw his hat upon the floor, wherever it
might land, and went to meet her, a great light glowing
in his tired eyes, his arms outstretched to hers.</p>

<p>“And did you care?” he asked in a voice of
almost awe. “Dear, did you <i>care</i> what became of
<i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>He had come quite close to her now.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I <i>cared</i>! I could not help it.” There
was a real sob in her voice now, though her eyes
were shining.</p>

<p>His arms went around her hungrily, as if he
would draw her to him in spite of everything; yet
he kept them so encircling, without touching her,
like a benediction that would enwrap the very soul
of his beloved. Looking down into her face he
breathed softly:</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, it seems as if I must hold you
close and kiss you!”</p>

<p>She looked up with bated breath, and thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
she understood. Then, with a lovely gesture of surrender,
she whispered, “I can trust you.” Her
lashes were drooping now over her eyes.</p>

<p>“Not until you know all,” he said, and put her
gently from him into the great arm-chair, with a
look of reverence and self-abnegation she felt she
never would forget.</p>

<p>“Then, tell me quickly,” she said, a swift fear
making her weak from head to foot. She laid her
hand across her heart, as if to help steady its beating.</p>

<p>He wheeled forward the leather couch opposite
her chair, and sat down, his head drooping, his eyes
down. He dreaded to begin.</p>

<p>She waited for the revelation, her eyes upon his
bowed head.</p>

<p>Finally he lifted his eyes and saw her look, and
a tender light came into his face.</p>

<p>“It is a strange story,” he said. “I don’t know
what you will think of me after it is told, but I want
you to know that, blundering, stupid, even criminal,
though you may think me, I would sooner die this
minute than cause you one more breath of suffering.”</p>

<p>Her eyes lit up with a wonderful light, and the
ready tears sprang into them, tears that sparkled
through the sunshine of a great joy that illumined
her whole face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Please go on,” she said softly, and added very
gently, “I believe you.”</p>

<p>But even with those words in his ears the beginning
was not easy. Gordon drew a deep breath and
launched forth.</p>

<p>“I am not the man you think,” he said, and
looked at her to see how she would take it. “My
name is not George Hayne. My name is Cyril
Gordon.”</p>

<p>As one might launch an arrow at a beloved victim
and long that it may not strike the mark, so he sent
his truth home to her understanding, and waited in
breathless silence, hoping against hope that this
might not turn her against him.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she breathed softly, as if some puzzle
were solving itself. “Oh!”—this time not altogether
in surprise, nor as if the fact were displeasing.
She looked at him expectantly for further
revelation, and he plunged into his story headlong.</p>

<p>“I’m a member of the Secret Service,—headquarters
here in Washington,—and day before yesterday
I was sent to New York on an important
errand. A message of great import written in a private
code had been stolen from one of our men. I
was sent to get it before they could decipher it.
The message involved matters of such tremendous
significance that I was ordered to go under an assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
name, and on no account to let anyone know
of my mission. My orders were to get the message,
and let nothing hinder me in bringing it with all
haste to Washington. I went with the full understanding
that I might even be called upon to risk my
life.”</p>

<p>He looked up. The girl sat wide-eyed, with
hands clasped together at her throat.</p>

<p>He hurried on, not to cause her any needless
anxiety.</p>

<p>“I won’t weary you with details. There were a
good many annoying hindrances on the way, which
served to make me nervous, but I carried out the programme
laid down by my chief, and succeeded in
getting possession of the message and making my
escape from the house of the man who had stolen it.
As I closed the door behind me, knowing that it
could be but a matter of a few seconds at longest
before six furious men would be on my track, who
would stop at nothing to get back what I had taken
from them, I saw a carriage standing almost before
the house. The driver took me for the man he
awaited, and I lost no time in taking advantage of his
mistake. I jumped in, telling him to drive as fast as
he could. I intended to give him further directions,
but he had evidently had them from another quarter,
and I thought I could call to him as soon as we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
out of the dangerous neighborhood. To add to my
situation I soon became sure that an automobile and
a motor-cycle were following me. I recognized one
of the men in the car as the man who sat opposite
to me at the table a few minutes before. My coachman
drove like mad, while I hurried to secure the
message so that if I were caught it would not be
found, and to put on a slight disguise—some eyebrows
and things the chief had given me. Before
I knew where I was, the carriage had stopped before
a building. At first I thought it was a prison—and
the car and motor-cycle came to a halt just behind
me. I felt that I was pretty well trapped.”</p>

<p>The girl gave a low moan, and Gordon, not daring
to look up, hurried on with his story.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much more to tell that you do not
already know. I soon discovered the building was
a church, not a prison. What happened afterward
was the result of my extreme perturbation of mind,
I suppose. I cannot account for my stupidity and
subsequent cowardice in any other way. Neither
was it possible for me to explain matters satisfactorily
at any time during the whole mix-up, on account
of the trust which I carried, and which I
could on no account reveal even in confidence, or put
in jeopardy in the slightest degree. Naturally at
first my commission and how to get safely through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
it all was the only thing of importance to me. If you
keep this in mind perhaps you will be able to judge
me less harshly. My only thought when the carriage
came to a halt was how to escape from those two
pursuers, and that more or less pervaded my mind
during what followed so that ordinary matters which
at another time would have been at once clear to
me, meant nothing at all. You see, the instant that
carriage came to a standstill some one threw open the
door, and I heard a voice call ‘Where is the best
man?’ Then another voice said, ‘Here he is!’ I
took it that they thought I was best man, but would
soon discover that I wasn’t when I came into the
light. There wasn’t any chance to slip away, or I
should have done so, and vanished in the dark, but
everybody surrounded me, and seemed to think I
was all right. The two men who had followed were
close behind eyeing me keenly. I’m satisfied that
they were to blame for that wild ride we took
in Pittsburgh! I soon saw by the remarks that
the man I was supposed to be had been away from
this country for ten years, and of course then
they would not be very critical. I tried twice to explain
that there was a mistake, but both times they
misunderstood me and thought I was saying I
couldn’t go in the procession because I hadn’t practised.
I don’t just know how I came to be in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
a dreadful mess. It would seem as if it ought to
have been a very easy thing to say I had got into the
wrong carriage and they must excuse me, that I
wasn’t their man, but, you see, they gave me no time
to think nor to speak. They just turned me over
from one man to another and took everything for
granted, and I, finding that I would have to break
loose and flee before their eyes if I wished to escape,
reflected that there would be no harm in marching
down the aisle as best man in a delayed wedding, if
that was all there was to do. I could disappear as
soon as the ceremony was over, and no one would be
the wiser. The real best man would probably turn
up and then they might wonder as they pleased for
I would be far away and perhaps this was as good
a place as any in which to hide for half an hour until
my pursuers were baffled and well on their way seeking
elsewhere for me. I can see now that I made
a grave mistake in allowing even so much deception,
but I did not see any harm in it then, and they all
seemed in great distress for the ceremony to go forward.
Bear in mind also that I was at that time
entirely taken up with the importance of hiding my
message until I could take it safely to my chief.
Nothing else seemed to matter much. If the real best
man was late to the wedding and they were willing to
use me in his place what harm could come from it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
He certainly deserved it for being late and if he came
in during the ceremony he would think some one else
had been put in his place. They introduced me to
your brother—Jefferson. I thought he was the
bridegroom, and I thought so until they laid your
hand in mine!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she moaned, and the little hand went to
help its mate cover her face.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” he said bitterly. “I knew you
would feel just that way as soon as you knew. I
don’t blame you. I deserve it! I was a fool, a villain,
a dumb brute—whatever you have a mind to
call me! You can’t begin to understand how I have
suffered for you since this happened, and how I have
blamed myself.”</p>

<p>He got up suddenly and strode over to the window,
frowning down into the sunlit street, and wondering
how it was that everybody seemed to be going
on in exactly the same hurry as ever, when for him
life had suddenly come to a standstill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> room was very still. The girl did not even
sob. He turned after a moment and went back to
that bowed golden head there in the deep crimson
chair.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, “I know you can’t ever
forgive me. I don’t expect it! I don’t deserve it!
But please don’t feel so awfully about it. I’ll explain
it all to every one. I’ll make it all right for
you. I’ll take every bit of blame on myself, and get
plenty of witnesses to prove all about it——”</p>

<p>The girl looked up with sorrow and surprise in
her wet eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, I do not blame you,” she said, mournfully.
“I cannot see how you were to blame. It
was no one’s fault. It was just an unusual happening—a
strange set of circumstances. I could not
blame you. There is nothing to forgive, and if there
were I would gladly forgive it!”</p>

<p>“Then what on earth makes you look so white
and feel so distressed?” he asked in a distracted
voice, as a man will sometimes look and talk to the
woman he loves when she becomes a tearful problem
of despair to his obtuse eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“No, I don’t,” he said. “You’re surely not
mourning for that brute of a man to whom you had
promised to sacrifice your life?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and buried her face in her
hands again. He could see that the tears were dropping
between her fingers, and they seemed to fall red
hot upon his heart.</p>

<p>“Then what is it?” His tone was almost sharp
in its demand, but she only cried the harder. Her
slender shoulders were shaking with her grief now.</p>

<p>He put his hand down softly and touched her
bowed head.</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me, Dear?” he breathed, and,
stooping, knelt beside her.</p>

<p>The sobs ceased, and she was quite still for a
moment, while his hand still lay on her hair with
that gentle, pleading touch.</p>

<p>“It is—because you married me—in—that way—without
knowing—— Oh, can’t you see how terrible——”</p>

<p>Oh, the folly and blindness of love! Gordon got
up from his knees as if she had stung him.</p>

<p>“You need not feel bad about that any more,”
he said in a hurt tone. “Did I not tell you I would
set you free at once? Surely no one in his senses
could call you bound after such circumstances.”</p>

<p>She was very still for an instant, as if he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
struck her, and then she raised her golden head, and
a pair of sweet eyes suddenly grown haughty.</p>

<p>“You mean that <i>I</i> will set <i>you</i> free!” she said
coldly. “I could not think of letting you be bound
by a misunderstanding when you were under great
stress of mind. You were in no wise to blame. <i>I</i>
will set <i>you</i> free.”</p>

<p>“As you please,” he retorted bitterly, turning
toward the window again. “It all amounts to the
same thing. There is nothing for you to feel bad
about.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” she answered, with a quick rush
of feeling that broke through her assumed haughtiness.
“I shall always feel that I have broken in
upon your life. You have had a most trying experience
with me, and you never can quite forget it.
Things won’t be the same——”</p>

<p>She paused and the quiet tears chased each other
eloquently down her face.</p>

<p>“No,” said Gordon still bitterly; “things will
never be the same for me. I shall always see you
sitting there in my chair. I shall always be missing
you from it! But I am glad—glad. I would never
have known what I missed if it had not been for
this.” He spoke almost savagely.</p>

<p>He did not look around, but she was staring at
him in astonishment, her blue eyes suddenly alight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“What do you mean?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>He wheeled round upon her. “I mean that I
shall never forget you; that I do not want to forget
you. I should rather have had these two days of
your sweet company, than all my lifetime in any
other companionship.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she breathed. “Then, why—why did
you say what you did about being free?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about being free that I
remember. It was you that said that.”</p>

<p>“I said I would set you free. I could not, of
course, hold you to a bond you did not want——”</p>

<p>“But I did not say I did not want it. I said I
would not hold you if <i>you</i> did not want to stay.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that if you had known me a little—that
is, just as much as you know me now—and
had come in there and found out your mistake before
it was too late, that you would have <i>wanted</i> to
go on with it?”</p>

<p>She waited for his answer breathlessly.</p>

<p>“If you had known me just as much as you do
now, and had looked up and seen that it was I and
not George Hayne you were marrying, would <i>you</i>
have wanted to go on and be married?”</p>

<p>Her cheeks grew rosy and her eyes confused.</p>

<p>“I asked you first,” she said, with just a flicker
of a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>He caught the shimmer of light in her eyes, and
came toward her eagerly, his own face all aglow
now with a dawning understanding.</p>

<p>“Darling,” he said, “I can go farther than you
have asked. From the first minute my eyes rested
upon your face under that mist of white veil I
wished with all my heart that I might have known
you before any other man had found and won you.
When you turned and looked at me with that deep
sorrow in your eyes, you pledged me with every fibre
of my being to fight for you. I was yours from that
instant. And when your little hand was laid in
mine, my heart went out in longing to have it stay
in mine forever. I know now, as I did not understand
then, that the real reason for my not doing
something to make known my identity at that instant
was not because I was afraid of any of the
things that might happen, or any scene I might make,
but because my heart was fighting for the right to
keep what had been given me out of the unknown.
You are my wife, by every law of heaven and earth,
if your heart will but say yes. I love you, as I
never knew a man could love, and yet if you do not
want to stay with me I will set you free; but it is
true that I should never be the same, for I am married
to you in my heart, and always shall be. Darling,
look up and answer my question now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>He stood before her with outstretched arms, and
for answer she rose and came to him slowly, with
downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be set free,” she said.</p>

<p>Then gently, tenderly, he folded his arms about
her, as if she were too precious to handle roughly,
and laid his lips upon hers.</p>

<p>It was the shrill, insistent clang of the telephone
bell that broke in upon their bliss. For a moment
Gordon let it ring, but its merciless clatter was not
to be denied; so, drawing Celia close within his arm,
he made her come with him to the ’phone.</p>

<p>To his annoyance, the haughty voice of Miss
Bentley answered him from the little black distance
of the ’phone.</p>

<p>His arm was about Celia, and she felt his whole
body stiffen with formality.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Bentley! Good-morning! Your
message? Why no! Ah! Well, I have but just
come in——”</p>

<p>A pause during which Celia, panic-stricken,
handed him the paper on which she had written
Julia’s message.</p>

<p>“Ah! Oh, yes, I have the message. Yes, it is
very kind of you—” he murmured stiffly, “but you
will have to excuse me. No, really. It is utterly
impossible! I have another engagement—” his arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
stole closer around Celia’s waist and caught her
hand, holding it with a meaningful pressure. He
smiled, with a grimace toward the telephone which
gladdened her heart. “Pardon me, I didn’t hear
that,” he went on.... “Oh, give up my engagement
and come?... Not possibly!”
His voice rang with a glad, decided force, and he
held still closer the soft fingers in his hand....
“Well, I’m sorry you feel that way about it. I
certainly am not trying to be disagreeable. No, I
could not come to-morrow night either....
I cannot make any plans for the next few days....
I may have to leave town again....
It is quite possible I may have to return to New
York. Yes, business has been very pressing. I hope
you will excuse me. I am sorry to disappoint you.
No, of course I didn’t do it on purpose. I shall have
some pleasant news to tell you when I see you again—or—”
with a glance of deep love at Celia, “perhaps
I shall find means to let you know of it before
I see you.”</p>

<p>The color came and went in Celia’s cheeks. She
understood what he meant and nestled closer to him.</p>

<p>“No, no, I could not tell it over the ’phone. No,
it will keep. Good things will always keep if they
are well cared for you know. No, really I can’t.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
And I’m very sorry to disappoint you to-night, but
it can’t be helped.... Good-by.”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Who is Miss Bentley?” asked Celia, with natural
interest. She was pleased that he had not addressed
her as “Julia.”</p>

<p>“Why, she is—a friend—I suppose you would
call her. She has been taking possession of my time
lately rather more than I really enjoyed. Still, she
is a nice girl. You’ll like her, I think; but I hope
you’ll never get too intimate. I shouldn’t like to
have her continually around. She——” he paused
and finished, laughing—“she makes me tired.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid, from her tone when she ’phoned
you, that she was a very dear friend—that she might
be some one you cared for. There was a sort of
proprietorship in her tone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the very word, proprietorship,” he
laughed. “I couldn’t care for her. I never did.
I tried to consider her in that light one day, because
I’d been told repeatedly that I ought to settle down,
but the thought of having her with me always was—well—intolerable.
The fact is, you reign supreme
in a heart that has never loved another girl. I didn’t
know there was such a thing as love like this. I
knew I lacked something, but I didn’t know what it
was. This is greater than all the gifts of life, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
gift of your love. And that it should come to me in
this beautiful, unsought way seems too good to be
true!”</p>

<p>He drew her to him once more and looked down
into her lovely face, as if he could not drink enough
of its sweetness.</p>

<p>“And to think you are willing to be my wife!
My wife!” and he folded her close again.</p>

<p>A discreet tap on the door announced the arrival
of the man Henry, and Gordon roused to the necessity
of ordering lunch.</p>

<p>He stepped to the door with a happy smile and
held it open.</p>

<p>“Come in a minute, Henry,” he said. “This
is my wife. I hope you will henceforth take her
wishes as your special charge, and do for her as you
have done so faithfully for me.”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes shone with pleasure as he bowed
low before the gentle lady.</p>

<p>“I is very glad to heah it, sah, and I offers you
my congratchumlations, sah, and de lady, too. She
can’t find no bettah man in the whole United States
dan Mars’ Gordon. I’s mighty glad you done got
ma’ied, sah, an’ I hopes you bof have a mighty fine
life.”</p>

<p>The luncheon was served in Henry’s best style,
and his dark face shone as he stepped noiselessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
about, putting silver and china and glass in place, and
casting admiring glances at the lady, who stood
holding the little miniature in her hand and asking
questions with a gentle voice:</p>

<p>“Your mother, you say? How dear she is!
And she died so long ago! You never knew her?
Oh, how strange and sweet and pitiful to have a
beautiful girl-mother like that!”</p>

<p>She put out her hand to his in the shelter of the
deep window, and they thought Henry did not see
the look and touch that passed between them; but
he discreetly averted his eyes and smiled benignly at
the salt-cellars and the celery he was arranging.
Then he hurried out to a florist’s next door and returned
with a dozen white roses, which he arranged
in a queer little crystal pitcher, one of the few articles
belonging to his mother that Gordon possessed. It
had never been used before, except to stand on the
mantel.</p>

<p>It was after they had finished their delightful
luncheon, and Henry had cleared the table and left
the room, that Gordon remarked:</p>

<p>“I wonder what has become of George Hayne.
Do you suppose he means to try to make trouble?”</p>

<p>Celia’s hands fluttered to her throat with a little
gesture of fear.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said. “I had forgotten him! How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
terrible! He will do <i>something</i>, of course. He will
do <i>everything</i>. He will probably carry out all his
threats. How could I have forgotten! Perhaps
Mamma is now in great distress. What can we do?
What can <i>I</i> do?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him helplessly, and his heart
bounded at the thought that she was his to protect
as long as life should last, and that she already depended
upon him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened,” he soothed her. “He
cannot do anything very dreadful, and if he tries
we’ll soon silence him. What he has written in those
letters is blackmail. He is simply a big coward, who
will run and hide as soon as he is exposed. He
thought you did not understand law, and so took
advantage of you. I’m sure I can silence him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think so? But Mamma! Poor
Mamma! It will kill her! And George will stop at
nothing when he is crossed. I have known him too
long. It will be <i>terrible</i> if he carries out his threat.”
Tears were in her eyes, agony was in her face.</p>

<p>“We must telephone your mother at once and
set her heart at rest. Then we can find out just what
ought to be done,” said Gordon soothingly. “It
was unforgivably thoughtless in me not to have
done it before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Celia’s face was radiant at the thought of speaking
to her mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, how beautiful! Why didn’t I think of that
before! What perfectly dear things telephones
are!”</p>

<p>With one accord, they went to the telephone
table.</p>

<p>“Shall you call them up, or shall I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You call, and then I will speak to Mamma,”
she said, her eyes shining with her joy in him. “I
want them to hear your voice again. They can’t
help knowing you are all right when they hear your
voice.”</p>

<p>For that, he gave her a glance very much worth
having.</p>

<p>“Just how do you account for the fact that you
didn’t think I was all right yesterday afternoon? I
have a very realizing sense that you didn’t. I used
my voice to the best of my ability, but it did no good
then.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, that was different! There were
those letters to be accounted for. Mamma and Jeff
don’t know anything about the letters.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to tell them now?”</p>

<p>She drew her brows down a minute and thought.</p>

<p>“You’d better find out how much they already
know,” he suggested. “If this George Hayne hasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
turned up yet, perhaps you can wait until you can
write, or we might be able to go up to-morrow and
explain it ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could we? How lovely!”</p>

<p>“I think we could,” said Gordon. “I’m sure
I can make it possible. Of course, you know a wedding
journey isn’t exactly in the program of the
Secret Service, but I might be able to work them for
one. I surely can in a few days if this Holman business
doesn’t hold me up. I may be needed for a
witness. I’ll have to talk with the chief first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how perfectly beautiful! Then you call
them up, and just say something pleasant—anything,
you know—and then say I’ll speak to Mamma.”</p>

<p>She gave him the number, and in a few minutes
a voice from New York said, “Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” called Gordon. “Is this Mr. Jefferson
Hathaway?... Well, this is your new
brother-in-law. How are you all?... Your
mother recovered from all the excitement and weariness?...
That’s good.... What’s
that?... You’ve been trying to ’phone us in
Chicago?... But we’re not in Chicago. We
changed our minds and came to Washington instead....
Yes, we’re in Washington—The Harris
Apartments. We have been very selfish not to have
communicated with you sooner. At least I have.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Celia hasn’t had any choice in the matter. I’ve kept
her so busy. Yes, she’s very well, and seems to look
happy. She wants to speak for herself. I’ll try to
arrange to bring her up to-morrow for a little visit.
I want to see you too. We’ve a lot of things to explain
to you.... Here is Celia. She wants to
speak to you.”</p>

<p>Celia, her eyes shining, her lips quivering with
suppressed excitement, took the receiver.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jeff dear, it’s good to hear your voice,” she
said. “Is everything all right? Yes, I’ve been having
a perfectly beautiful time, and I’ve something
fine to tell you. All those nice things you said to me
just before you got off the train are true. Yes, he’s
just as nice as you said, and a great deal nicer besides.
Oh, yes, I’m very happy, and I want to speak
to Mamma please. Jeff, is she all right? Is she
<i>perfectly</i> well, and not fretting a bit? You know
you promised to tell me. What’s that? She thought
I looked sad? Well, I did but that’s all gone now.
Everything is perfectly beautiful. Tell mother to
come to the ’phone please—I want to make her understand.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell her, dear,” she whispered,
looking up at Gordon. “I’m afraid George will get
there before we do and make her worry.”</p>

<p>For answer he stooped and kissed her, his arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
encircling her and drawing her close. “Whatever
you think best, dearest,” he whispered back.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Mamma?” With a happy smile she
turned back to the ’phone. “Dear Mamma! Yes, I’m
all safe and happy, and I’m so sorry you have worried.
We won’t let you do it again. But listen;
I’ve something to tell you, a surprise—Mamma, I
did not marry George Hayne at all. No, I say I <i>did
not</i> marry George Hayne at all. George Hayne is a
wicked man. I can’t tell you about it over the ’phone
but that was why I looked sad. Yes, I was <i>married</i>
all right, but not to George. He’s oh, so different,
Mother you can’t think. He’s right here beside me
now, and Mother, he is just as dear—you’d be very
happy about him if you could see him. What did
you say? Didn’t I mean to marry George? Why
Mother, I never wanted to. I was awfully unhappy
about it, and I knew I made you feel so too, though
I tried not to. But I’ll explain all about it. You’ll
be perfectly satisfied when you know all about it....
No, there’s nothing whatever for you to
worry about. Everything is right now and life looks
more beautiful to me than it ever did before. What’s
his name? Oh;” she looked up at Gordon with a
funny little expression of dismay. She had forgotten
and he whispered it in her ear.</p>

<p>“Cyril—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“It’s Cyril, Mother! Isn’t that a pretty name?
Which name? Oh, the first name of course. The
last name?”</p>

<p>“Gordon—” he supplied in her ear again.</p>

<p>“Cyril Gordon, Mother,” she said, giggling in
spite of herself at her strange predicament....
“Yes, Mother. I am very, very happy. I couldn’t
be happier unless I had you and Jeff, too, and”—she
paused, hesitating at the unaccustomed name—“and
Cyril says we’re coming to visit you to-morrow.
We’ll come up and see you and explain everything.
And you’re not to worry about George
Hayne if he comes. Just let Jeff put him off by telling
him you have sent for me, or something of the
sort, and don’t pay any attention to what he says.
What? You say he did come? How strange—and
he hasn’t been back? I’m so thankful. He is dreadful.
Oh, Mother, you don’t know what I’ve escaped!
And Cyril is good and dear. What? You
want to speak to him? All right. He’s right here.
Good-by, Mother, dear, till to-morrow. And you’ll
promise not to worry about anything? All right.
Here is—Cyril.”</p>

<p>Gordon took the receiver.</p>

<p>“Mother, I’m taking good care of her, just as I
promised, and I’m going to bring her for a flying
visit up to see you to-morrow. Yes, I’ll take good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
care of her. She is very dear to me. The best thing
that ever came into my life.”</p>

<p>Then a mother’s blessing came thrilling over the
wires, and touched the handsome, manly face with
tenderness.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “I shall try always to
make you glad you said those words.”</p>

<p>They returned to looking in each other’s eyes,
after the receiver was hung up, as if they had been
parted a long time. It seemed somehow as if their
joy must be greater than any other married couple,
because they had all their courting yet to do. It was
beautiful to think of what was before them.</p>

<p>There was so much on both sides to be told; and
to be told over again because only half had been told;
and there were so many hopes and experiences to be
exchanged; so many opinions to compare, and to rejoice
over because they were alike on many essentials.
Then there were the rooms to be gone through, and
Gordon’s pictures and favorite books to look at
and talk about, and plans for the future to be touched
upon—just barely touched upon.</p>

<p>The apartment would do until they could look
about and get a house, Gordon said, his heart swelling
with the proud thought that at last he would have
a real home, like his other married friends, with a
real princess to preside over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Then Celia had to tell all about the horror of the
last three months, with the unpleasant shadows of
the preceding years back of it. She told this in the
dusk of evening, before Henry had come in to light
up, and before they had realized that it was almost
dinner-time. She told it with her face hidden on her
husband’s shoulder, and his arms close about her,
to give her comfort at each revelation of the story.
They tried also to plan what to do about George
Hayne; and then there was the whole story of Gordon’s
journey and commission from the time the
old chief had called him into the office until he came
to stand beside her at the church altar and they were
married. It was told in careful detail with all the
comical, exasperating and pitiful incidents of white
dog and little newsboy; but the strangest part about
it all was that Gordon never said one word about
Julia Bentley and her imaginary presence with him
that first day, and he never even knew that he had
left out an important detail.</p>

<p>Celia laughed over the white dog and declared
they must bring him home to live with them; and she
cried over the story of the brave little newsboy and
was eager to visit him in New York, promising herself
all sorts of pleasure in taking him gifts and permanently
bettering his condition; and it was in this
way that Gordon incidentally learned that his wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
had a fortune in her own right, a fact that for a
time gave him great uneasiness of mind until she had
soothed him and laughed at him for an hour or
more; for Gordon was an independent creature and
had ideas about supporting his wife by his own toil.
Besides it seemed an unfair advantage to have taken
a wife and a fortune as it were unaware.</p>

<p>But Celia’s fortune had not spoiled her, and she
soon made him see that it had always been a mere
incident in her scheme of living; comfortable and
pleasant incident to be sure, but still an incident to
be kept always in the background, and never for a
moment to be a cause for self-gratulation or pride.</p>

<p>Gordon found himself dreading the explanation
that would have to come when he reached New York
and faced his wife’s mother and brother. Celia had
accepted his explanations, because, somehow by the
beautiful ways of the spirit, her soul had found and
believed in his soul before the truth was made known
to her, but would her mother and brother be able
also to believe? And he fell to planning with Celia
just how he should tell the story; and this led to his
bringing out a number of letters and papers that
would be worth while showing as credentials, and
every step of the way, as Celia got glimpse after
glimpse into his past, her face shone with joy and
her heart leaped with the assurance that her lot had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
been cast in goodly places, for she perceived not only
that this man was honored and respected in high
places, but that his early life had been peculiarly
pure and true.</p>

<p>The strange loneliness that had surrounded his
young manhood seemed suddenly to have broken
ahead of him, and to have opened out into the glory
of the companionship of one peculiarly fitted to fill
the need of his life. Thus they looked into one another’s
eyes reading their life-joy, and entered into
the beautiful miracle of acquaintanceship.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning quite early the ’phone called
Gordon to the office. The chief’s secretary said the
matter was urgent.</p>

<p>He hurried away leaving Celia somewhat
anxious lest their plans for going to New York that
day could not be carried out, but she made up her
mind not to fret even if the trip had to be put off a
little, and solaced herself with a short visit with her
mother over the telephone.</p>

<p>Gordon entered his chief’s office a trifle anxiously,
for he felt that in justice to his wife he ought
to take her right back to New York and get matters
there adjusted; but he feared that there would be
business to hold him at home until the Holman
matter was settled.</p>

<p>The chief greeted him affably and bade him sit
down.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have called you up so early,” he
said, “but we needed you. The fact is, they’ve
arrested Holman and five other men, and you are in
immediate demand to identify them. Would it be
asking too much of an already overworked man to
send you back to New York to-day?”</p>

<p>Gordon almost sprang from his seat in pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“It just exactly fits in with my plans, or, rather,
my wishes,” he said, smiling. “There are several
matters of my own that I would like to attend to in
New York and for which of course I did not have
time.”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at his chief, half hesitating,
marvelling that the way had so miraculously
opened for him to keep silence a little longer on the
subject of his marriage. Perhaps the chief need
never be told that the marriage ceremony took place
on the day of the Holman dinner.</p>

<p>“That is good,” said the chief, smiling. “You
certainly have earned the right to attend to your own
affairs. Then we need not feel so bad at having to
send you back. Can you go on the afternoon train?
Good! Then let us hear your account of your trip
briefly, to see if there are any points we didn’t notice
yesterday. But first just step here a moment. I
have something to show you.”</p>

<p>He flung open the door to the next office.</p>

<p>“You knew that Ferry had left the Department
on account of his ill-health? I have taken the liberty
of having your things moved in here. This will
hereafter be your headquarters, and you will be next
to me in the Department.”</p>

<p>Gordon turned in amazement and gazed at the
kindly old face. Promotion he had hoped for, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
such promotion, right over the heads of his elders
and superiors, he had never dreamed of receiving.
He could have taken the chief in his arms.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Pooh!” said the chief. “You deserve
it, you deserve it!” when Gordon tried to blunder
out some words of appreciation. Then, as if to cap
the climax, he added:</p>

<p>“And, by the way, you know some one has got
to run across the water to look after that Stanhope
matter. That will fall to you, I’m afraid. Sorry
to keep you trotting around the globe, but perhaps
you’ll like to make a little vacation of it. The Department’ll
give you some time if you want it. Oh,
don’t thank me! It’s simply the reward of doing
your duty, to have more duties given you, and higher
ones. You have done well, young man. I have here
all the papers in the Stanhope case, and full directions
written out, and then if you can plan for it you
needn’t return, unless it suits your pleasure. You
understand the matter as fully as I do already. And
now for business. Let’s hurry through. There are
one or two little matters we must talk over and I
know you will want to hurry back and get ready for
your journey.” And so after all the account of
Gordon’s extraordinary escape and eventful journey
home became by reason of its hasty repetition a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
most prosaic story composed of the bare facts and
not all of those.</p>

<p>At parting the chief pressed Gordon’s hand with
heartiness and ushered him out into the hall, with
the same brusque manner he used to close all business
interviews, and Gordon found himself hurrying
through the familiar halls in a daze of happiness, the
secret of his unexpected marriage still his own—and
hers.</p>

<p>Celia was watching at the window when his key
clicked in the lock and he let himself into the apartment
his face alight with the joy of meeting her
again after the brief absence. She turned in a quiver
of pleasure at his coming.</p>

<p>“Well, get ready,” he said joyfully. “We are
ordered off to New York on the afternoon train,
with a wedding trip to Europe into the bargain; and
I’m promoted to the next place to the chief. What
do you think of that for a morning’s surprise?”</p>

<p>He tossed up his hat like a boy, came over to
where she stood, and stooping laid reverent lips upon
her brow and eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, beautiful! lovely!” cried Celia, ecstatically,
“come sit down on the couch and tell me about
it. We can work faster afterward if we get it off
our minds. Was your chief very much shocked that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
you were married without his permission or knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Why, that was the best of all. I didn’t have
to tell him I was married. And he is not to know
until just as I sail. He need never know how it all
happened. It isn’t his business and it would be hard
to explain. No one need ever know except your
mother and brother unless you wish them to, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad and relieved,” said Celia, delightedly.
“I’ve been worrying about that a little,—what
people would think of us,—for of course we
couldn’t possibly explain it all out as it is to us.
They would always be watching us to see if we
really cared for each other; and suspecting that we
didn’t, and it would be horrid. I think it is our own
precious secret, and nobody but mamma and Jeff
have a right to know, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do, and I was casting about in my
mind as I went into the office how I could manage
not to tell the chief, when what did he do but spring
a proposition on me to go at once to New York and
identify those men. He apologized tremendously
for having to send me right back again, but said it
was necessary. I told him it just suited me for I
had affairs of my own that I had not had time to
attend to when I was there, and would be glad to
go back and see to them. That let me out on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
wedding question for it would be only necessary to
tell him I was married when I got back. He would
never ask when.”</p>

<p>“But the announcements,” said Celia catching
her breath laughingly, “I never thought of that.
We’ll just have to have some kind of announcements
or my friends will not understand about my new
name; and we’ll have to send him one, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. Couldn’t we get along
without announcements? You can explain to your
intimate friends, and the others won’t ever remember
the name after a few months—we’ll not be likely
to meet many of them right away. I’ll write to my
chief and tell him informally leaving out the date
entirely. He won’t miss it. If we have announcements
at all we needn’t send him one. He wouldn’t
be likely ever to see one any other way, or to notice
the date. I think we can manage that matter. We’ll
talk it over with your—” he hesitated and then smiling
tenderly added, “we’ll talk it over with <i>mother</i>.
How good it sounds to say that. I never knew my
mother you know.”</p>

<p>Celia nestled her hands in his and murmured,
“Oh, I am so happy,—so happy! But I don’t understand
how you got a wedding trip without telling
your chief about our marriage.”</p>

<p>“Easy as anything. He asked me if I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
mind running across the water to attend to a matter
for the service and said I might have extra time
while there for a vacation. He never suspects that
vacation is to be used as a wedding trip. I’ll write
him, or ’phone him the night we leave New York. I
may have to stay in the city two or three days to
get this Holman matter settled, and then we can be
off. In the meantime you can spend the time reconciling
your mother to her new son. Do you think
we’ll have a very hard time explaining matters to
her?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Celia, gaily. “She never did
like George. It was the only thing we ever disagreed
about, my marrying him. She suspected all
the time I wasn’t happy and couldn’t understand why
I insisted on marrying him when I hadn’t seen him
for ten years. She begged me to wait until he had
been back in the country for a year or two, but he
would not hear to such a thing and threatened to
carry out his worst at once.”</p>

<p>Gordon’s heart suddenly contracted with righteous
wrath over the cowardliness of the man who
sought to gain his own ends by intimidating a
woman,—and this woman, so dear, so beautiful, so
lovely in her nature. It seemed the man’s heart
must indeed be black to have done what he did. He
mentally resolved to search him out and bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
him to justice as soon as he reached New York. It
puzzled him to understand how easily he seemed to
have abandoned his purposes. Perhaps after all he
was more of a coward than they thought, and had
not dared to remain in the country when he found
that Celia had braved his wrath and married another
man. He would find out about him and set the girl’s
heart at rest just as soon as possible, that any
embarrassment at some future time might be avoided.
Gordon stooped and kissed his wife again, a caress
that seemed to promise all reparation for the past.</p>

<p>But it suddenly occurred to the two that trains
did not wait for lovers’ long loitering, and with one
accord they went to work. Celia of course had very
little preparation to make. Her trunk was probably
in Chicago and would need to be wired for. Gordon
attended to that the first thing, looking up the number
of the check and ordering it back to New York
by telegraph. Turning from the telephone he rang
for the man and asked Celia to give the order for
lunch while he got together some things that he
must take with him. A stay of several weeks would
necessitate a little more baggage than he had taken
to New York.</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom and began pulling out
things to pack but when Celia turned from giving
her directions she found him standing in the bedroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
doorway with an old-fashioned velvet jewel case in
his hand which he had just taken from the little
safe in his room. His face wore a wonderful tender
light as if he had just discovered something precious.</p>

<p>“Dear,” he said, “I wonder if you will care for
these. They were mother’s. Perhaps this ring will
do until I can buy you a new one. See if it will fit
you. It was my mother’s.”</p>

<p>He held out a ring containing a diamond of
singular purity and brilliance in quaint old-fashioned
setting.</p>

<p>Celia put out her hand with its wedding ring, the
ring that he had put upon her finger at the altar, and
he slipped the other jewelled one above it. It fitted
perfectly.</p>

<p>“It is a beauty,” breathed Celia, holding out her
hand to admire it, “and I would far rather have it
than a new one. Your dear little mother!”</p>

<p>“There’s not much else here but a little string of
pearls and a pin or two. I have always kept them
near me. Somehow they seemed like a link between
me and mother. I was keeping them for—” he hesitated
and then giving her a rare smile he finished:</p>

<p>“I was keeping them for you.”</p>

<p>Her answering look was eloquent, and needed no
words which was well, for Henry appeared at that
moment to serve luncheon and remind his master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
that his train left in a little over two hours. There
was no further time for sentiment.</p>

<p>And yet, these two, it seemed, could not be practical
that day. They idled over their luncheon and
dawdled over their packing, stopping to look at this
and that picture or bit of bric-a-brac that Gordon
had picked up in some of his travels; and Henry
finally had to take things in his own hands, pack
them off and send their baggage after them. Henry
was a capable man and rejoiced to see the devotion
of his master and his new mistress, but he had a
practical head and knew where his part came in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> journey back to New York seemed all too
brief for the two whose lives had just been blended
so unexpectedly, and every mile was filled with a
new and sweet discovery of delight in one another;
and then, when they reached the city they rushed in
on Mrs. Hathaway and the eager young Jeff like
two children who had so much to tell they did not
know where to begin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hathaway settled the matter by insisting
on their going to dinner immediately and leaving
all explanations until afterward; and with the servants
present of course there was little that could
be said about the matter that each one had most at
heart. But there was a spirit of deep happiness in
the atmosphere and one couldn’t possibly entertain
any fears under the influence of the radiant smiles
that passed between mother and daughter, husband
and wife, brother and sister.</p>

<p>As soon as the meal was concluded the mother
led them up to her private sitting room, and closing
the door she stood facing them all as half breathless
with the excitement of the moment they stood in a
row before her:</p>

<p>“My three dear children!” she murmured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
Gordon’s eyes lit with joy and his heart thrilled with
the wonder of it all. Then the mother stepped up
to him and placing her hand on his arm led him over
to the couch and made him sit beside her, while the
brother and sister sat down together close by.</p>

<p>“Now, Cyril, my new son,” said she, deliberately,
her eyes resting approvingly upon his face,
“you may tell me your story. I see my girl has lost
both head and heart to you and I doubt if she could
tell it connectedly.”</p>

<p>And while Celia and Jeff were laughing at this
Gordon set about his task of winning a mother, and
incidentally an eager-eyed young brother who was
more than half committed to his cause already.</p>

<p>Celia watched proudly as her handsome husband
took out his credentials, and began his explanation.</p>

<p>“First, I must tell you who I am, and these
papers will do it better than I could. Will you look
at them, please?”</p>

<p>He handed her a few letters and papers.</p>

<p>“These papers on the top show the rank and
position that my father and my grandfather held
with the government and in the army. This is a
letter from the president to my father congratulating
him on his approaching marriage with my
mother. That paper contains my mother’s family
tree, and the letters with it will give you an idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
the honor in which my mother’s family was held in
Washington and in Virginia, her old home. I know
these matters are not of much moment, and say
nothing whatever about what I am myself, but they
are things you would have been likely to know about
my family if you had known me all my life; and at
least they will tell you that my family was respectable.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hathaway was examining the papers, and
suddenly looked up exclaiming: “My dear! My
father knew your grandfather. I think I saw him
once when he came to our home in New York. It
was years ago and I was a young girl, but I remember
he was a fine looking man with keen dark eyes,
and a heavy head of iron gray hair.”</p>

<p>She looked at Gordon keenly.</p>

<p>“I wonder if your eyes are not like his. It was
long ago of course.”</p>

<p>“They used to say I looked like him. I do not
remember him. He died when I was very young.”</p>

<p>The mother looked up with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“Now tell me about yourself,” she said and laid
a gentle hand on his.</p>

<p>Gordon looked down, an embarrassed flush
spreading over his face.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing great to tell,” he said. “I’ve
always tried to live a straight true life, and I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
never been in love with any girl before—” he flashed
a wonderful, blinding smile upon Celia.</p>

<p>“I was left alone in the world when quite young
and have lived around in boarding-schools and college.
I’m a graduate of Harvard and I’ve travelled
a little. There was some money left from my
father’s estate, not much. I’m not rich. I’m a
Secret Service man, and I love my work. I get a
good salary and was this morning promoted to the
position next in rank to my chief, so that now I shall
have still more money. I shall be able to make your
daughter comfortable and give her some of the
luxuries, if not all, to which she has been accustomed.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, that part is not what I am anxious
about—” interrupted the mother.</p>

<p>“I know,” said Gordon, “but it is a detail you
have a right to be told. I understand that you care
far more what I am than how much money I can
make, and I promise you I am going to try to be all
that you would want your daughter’s husband to be.
Perhaps the best thing I can say for myself is that
I love her better than my life, and I mean to make
her happiness the dearest thing in life to me.”</p>

<p>The mother’s look of deep understanding answered
him more eloquently than words could have
done, and after a moment she spoke again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“But I do not understand how you could have
known one another and I never have heard of you.
Celia is not good at keeping things from her mother,
though the last three months she has had a sadness
that I could not fathom, and was forced to lay to
her natural dread of leaving home. She seemed so
insistent upon having this marriage just as George
planned it—and I was so afraid she would regret
not waiting. How could you have known one another
all this time and she never talked to me about
it, and why did George Hayne have any part whatever
in it if you two loved one another? Just how
long have you known each other anyway? Did it
begin when you visited in Washington last spring,
Celia?”</p>

<p>With dancing eyes Celia shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, Mamma. If I had met him then I’m sure
George Hayne would never have had anything to
do with the matter, for Cyril would have known how
to help me out of my difficulty.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell you the whole story from
my standpoint, and from the beginning,” said Gordon,
dreading now that the crisis was upon him,
what the outcome would be. “I have wanted you
to know who and what I was before you knew the
story, that you might judge me as kindly as possible,
and know that however I may have been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
blame in the matter it was through no intention of
mine. My story may sound rather impossible. I
know it will seem improbable, but it is nevertheless
true, everything that I have to tell. May I hope
to be believed?”</p>

<p>“I think you may,” answered the mother searching
his face anxiously. “Those eyes of yours are
not lying eyes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said simply, and then gathering
all his courage he plunged into his story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hathaway was watching him with searching
interest. Jeff had drawn his chair up close and
could scarcely restrain his excitement, and when
Gordon told of his commission he burst forth
explosively:</p>

<p>“Gee! But that was a great stunt! I’d have
liked to have been along with you! You must be
simply great to be trusted with a thing like that!”</p>

<p>But his mother gently reproved him:</p>

<p>“Hush, my son, let us hear the story.”</p>

<p>Celia sat quietly watching her husband with
pride, two bright spots of color on her cheeks, and
her hands clasping each other tightly. She was
hearing many details now that were new to her.
Once more, when Gordon mentioned the dinner at
Holman’s Jeff interrupted with:</p>

<p>“Holman! Holman! Not J. P.? Why of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
course—we know him! Celia was one of his
daughter’s bridesmaids last spring! The old lynx!
I always thought he was crooked! People hint a
lot of things about him—”</p>

<p>“Jeff, dear, let us hear the story,” again insisted
his mother, and the story continued.</p>

<p>Gordon had been looking down as he talked. He
dreaded to see their faces as the truth should dawn
upon them, but when he had told all he lifted honest
eyes to the white-faced mother and pleaded with her:</p>

<p>“Indeed, indeed, I hope you will believe me,
that not until they laid your daughter’s hand in mine
did I know that I was supposed to be the bridegroom.
I thought all the time her brother was the
bridegroom. If I had not been so distraught, and
trying so hard to think how to escape, I suppose I
would have noticed that I was standing next to her,
and that everything was peculiar about the whole
matter, but I didn’t. And then when I suddenly
knew that she and I were being married, what should
I have done? Do you think I ought to have stopped
the ceremony then and there and made a scene before
all those people? What was the right thing to do?
Suppose my commission had been entirely out of
the question, and I had had no duty toward the government
to keep entirely quiet about myself, do you
think I ought to have made a scene? Would you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
have wanted me to for your daughter’s sake? Tell
me please,” he insisted, gently.</p>

<p>And while she hesitated he added:</p>

<p>“I did some pretty hard thinking during that
first quarter of a second that I realized what was
happening, and I tell you honestly I didn’t know
what was the right thing to do. It seemed awful
for her sake to make a scene, and to tell you the
truth I worshipped her from the moment my eyes
rested upon her. There was something sad and appealing
as she looked at me that seemed to pledge
my very life to save her from trouble. Tell me, do
you think I ought to have stopped the ceremony then
at the first moment of my realization that I was
being married?”</p>

<p>The mother’s face had softened as she watched
him and listened to his tender words about Celia
and now she answered gently:</p>

<p>“I am not sure—perhaps not! It was a very
grave question to face. I don’t know that I can
blame you for doing nothing. It would have been
terrible for her and us and everybody and have made
it all so public. Oh, I think you did right not to do
anything publicly—perhaps—and yet—it is terrible
to me to think you have been forced to marry my
daughter in that way.”</p>

<p>“Please do not say forced,—<i>Mother</i>—” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
Gordon laying both hands earnestly upon hers and
looking into her eyes, “I tell you one thing that held
me back from doing anything was that I so earnestly
desired that what I was passing through might be
real and lasting. I have never seen one like her
before. I know that if the mistake had been righted
and she had passed out of my life I should never
have felt the same again. I am glad, glad with all
my heart that she is mine, and—Mother!—I think
she is glad too!”</p>

<p>The mother turned toward her daughter, and
Celia with starry eyes came and knelt before them,
and laid her hands in the hands of her husband, saying
with ringing voice:</p>

<p>“Yes, dear little Mother, I am gladder than I
ever was before in my life.”</p>

<p>And kneeling thus, with her husband’s arm about
her, her face against his shoulder, and both her hands
clasped in his, she told her mother about the tortures
that George Hayne had put her through, until
the mother turned white with horror at what her
beloved and cherished child had been enduring, and
the brother got up and stormed across the floor,
vowing vengeance on the luckless head of poor
George Hayne.</p>

<p>Then after the mother had given her blessing to
the two, and Jeff had added an original one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
own, there was the whole story of the eventful wedding
trip to tell, which they both told by solos and
choruses until the hour grew alarmingly late and
the mother suddenly sent them all off to bed.</p>

<p>The next few days were both busy and happy
ones for the two. They went to the hospital and
gladdened the life of the little newsboy with fruit
and toys and many promises; and they brought home
a happy white dog from his boarding place whom
Jeff adopted as his own. Gordon had a trying hour
or two at court with his one-time host, the scoundrel
who had stolen the cipher message; and the thick-set
man glared at him from a cell window as he passed
along the corridor of the prison whither he had gone
in search of George Hayne.</p>

<p>Gordon in his search for the lost bridegroom,
whom for many reasons he desired to find as soon as
possible, had asked the help of one of the men at
work on the Holman case, in searching for a certain
George Hayne who needed very much to be brought
to justice.</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t have to search for him,” declared
the man with a smile. “He’s safely landed
in prison three days ago. He was caught as neatly
as rolling off a log by the son of the man whose
name he forged several years ago. It was trust
money of a big corporation and the man died in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
place in a prison cell, but the son means to see the
real culprit punished.”</p>

<p>And so Gordon, in the capacity of Celia’s lawyer,
went to the prison to talk with George Hayne, and
that miserable man found no excuse for his sins
when the searching talk was over. Gordon did not
let the man know who he was, and merely made it
understood that Celia was married, and that if he
attempted to make her any further trouble the whole
thing would be exposed and he would have to answer
a grave charge of blackmail.</p>

<p>The days passed rapidly, and at last the New
York matter for which Gordon’s presence was
needed was finished, and he was free to sail away
with his bride. On the morning of their departure
Gordon’s voice rang out over the miles of telephone
wires to his old chief in Washington: “I am married
and am just starting on my wedding trip. Don’t
you want to congratulate me?” And the old chief’s
gruff voice sounded back:</p>

<p>“Good work, old man! Congratulations for
you both. She may or may not be the best girl in
all the world; I haven’t had a chance to see yet; but
she’s a lucky girl, for she’s got <i>the best man I know</i>.
Tell her that for me! Bless you both! I’m glad
she’s going with you. It won’t be so lonesome.”</p>

<p>Gordon gave her the message that afternoon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
they sailed straight into the sunshine of a new and
beautiful life together.</p>

<p>“Dear,” he said, as he arranged her steamer
rug more comfortably about her, “has it occurred
to you that you are probably the only bride who ever
married the best man at her wedding?”</p>

<p>Celia smiled appreciatively and after a minute
replied mischievously:</p>

<p>“I suppose every bride <i>thinks</i> her husband is the
best man.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
